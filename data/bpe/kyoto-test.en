Inf@@ ob@@ ox Buddhist
Dogen was a Zen monk in the early Kamakura period .
The founder of Soto Zen
Later in his life he also went by the name K@@ igen .
Within the sect he is referred to by the honorary title Kos@@ o .
Pos@@ thum@@ ously named Bus@@ sho Dento Kokushi , or Jo@@ yo-@@ Daishi .
He is generally called Dogen Zenji .
He is rep@@ uted to have been the one that spread the practices of t@@ ooth bru@@ shing , face washing , table manners and clean@@ ing in Japan .
Another story has it that he was the first one to bring M@@ os@@ o-@@ chiku ( M@@ oso bamboo ) to Japan .
Though some points are unclear about Dogen 's birth , all accounts agree that he was born in the line of Udaijin ( Minister of the Right ) Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO ( MINAMOTO no Michichika or Michichika KOGA ) .
Although it is generally accepted that he was born in Sh@@ oden San@@ so in Koh@@ ata , Kyoto , to Michichika and FUJIWARA no I@@ shi , the daughter of Daijo-daijin ( Grand Minister of State ) Motofusa MATSU@@ D@@ ONO ( FUJIWARA no Motofusa ) , recent research suggests that he may have been the son of Michit@@ omo HORI@@ KAWA , who was presumed to be his adoptive father .
Another account says his father was the son of Michichika , MINAMOTO no Michim@@ une or Michi@@ teru KOGA .
According to the biography " Ken@@ z@@ ei@@ ki " , he lost his father ( Michichika ) at 3 years of age , his mother at 8 , and was adopted by his half brother Michit@@ omo HORI@@ KAWA .
Yet another account tells that his maternal uncle Moro@@ ie MATSU@@ D@@ ONO ( former Regent and Interior Minister ) wanted to adopt him as an heir after his parents died , but Dogen , feeling the un@@ certain@@ ty of the world , declined .
There is a story that he was acquainted with Shinran , the founder of Shin Buddhism , as they were related via their mo@@ thers ; but there is no proof .
Some have said that the " Life and De@@ ath " section of his " Shob@@ og@@ en@@ zo " was written for Shinran .
Ken@@ ryaku 3 ( 12@@ 13 ) - Vis@@ ited his maternal uncle Ryok@@ en at Mt . Hiei .
12@@ 14 - En@@ tered the priesthood under Ko@@ en , the head of Tendai Buddhism , and took the name B@@ up@@ p@@ obo Dogen .
12@@ 15 - Pur@@ su@@ ed Tendai religious studies under Ko@@ in at Onjo-ji Temple .
12@@ 17 - Stu@@ died under Myo@@ zen , a disciple of E@@ isai , at Kennin-ji Temple .
12@@ 23 - Left from Hakata with Myo@@ zen to Southern Song China and visited J@@ ozan , where he received a certificate of dharma transmission from Soto Zen 's T@@ endo Nyo@@ zo .
12@@ 28 - Ret@@ ur@@ ned to Japan .
12@@ 33 - Op@@ ened Ko@@ sho-ji Temple at Fukakusa , Kyoto .
Around this time he came under pressure from Mt . Hiei .
July , 12@@ 43 - M@@ oved to Echizen Shi@@ hi@@ -no-@@ sho at the invitation of Yoshishige HA@@ TA@@ NO , lord of Echizen Province .
On the way , he stopped in K@@ utsuki at the invitation of the village chief , Nobut@@ suna SASAKI ( this is the origin of Ko@@ sho-ji Temple in Takashima City ) .
12@@ 44 - Op@@ ened Dai@@ butsu@@ -ji Temple in Kas@@ amatsu .
12@@ 46 - Chang@@ ed the name of Dai@@ butsu@@ -ji to Ei@@ hei@@ -ji Temple , and his own name to K@@ igen .
Around this time he went to Kamakura to teach , at the invitation of Regent Tokiyori HOJO and Yoshishige HA@@ TA@@ NO .
Although he only spent half of a year in Kamakura , it was the beginning of a genuine flour@@ ishing of Zen in the Kanto region .
12@@ 53 - After falling ill and turning over Ei@@ hei@@ -ji to his disciple K@@ oun E@@ jo , he died at the house ( Tak@@ atsu@@ ji-@@ dori Nishin@@ oto@@ in-@@ dori , Kyoto ) of a lay disciple , Kak@@ un@@ en , at age 54 .
C@@ ause of death was a bo@@ il .
He emphasized that Buddha@@ hood is not something that is completed once one has attained a certain level ; rather , continuing to seek further Buddha@@ hood through end@@ less training , even after one has become a Buddha , is the essence of Buddha@@ hood ( Shu@@ sho Ichin@@ yo ) ; and the highest form of training is to be like the Sak@@ yamuni and simply do sitting meditation ( Shi@@ kan T@@ aza ) .
Most of Kamakura Buddhism aff@@ ir@@ med the notion of the dec@@ ad@@ ent age , but in his Shob@@ og@@ en@@ zo Zu@@ im@@ on@@ ki he wrote " I tell you now , this is completely false .
The idea of the decline of true Buddha@@ -@@ dharma is only a temporary means for teaching .
The true teaching is different .
By training according to the teaching , any@@ body can achieve enlightenment .
The monks at the time of the Sak@@ yamuni were not all outstanding people .
There were those who had rare and inc@@ redi@@ ble evil in their hear@@ ts , and there were f@@ ools .
The many rules that the Say@@ kam@@ uni made were for the bad and fo@@ ol@@ ish people .
People are all owners of the quality to be able to become Buddha .
D@@ on 't think that you are not qualified . If you train according to the teaching , you will su@@ rely attain enlightenment . " He thus noted that the disciples at the time of Sak@@ yamuni were not all outstanding people , den@@ ying the dec@@ ad@@ ent age by saying that it is nothing more than a skill@@ ful means .

The Umekoji Ste@@ am Loc@@ omo@@ tive Museum is a preservation and display facility for steam locomotives , operated by West Japan Railway Company ( JR West Japan ) , located in Kan@@ ki@@ ji-cho , Shimog@@ yo-ku , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
On October 10 , 1972 , the Japan National Railway opened a sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar gar@@ age at the Umekoji eng@@ ine yard in Shimog@@ y@@ ou@@ -@@ ku , Kyoto in celebration of the 100@@ th anniversary of the first railway in Japan . The first of its kind , this facility preserv@@ es working steam locomotives , honor@@ ing them as precious artifacts of industrial culture that supported the Japanese rail transport system .
JR West Japan took over the facility in 1987 , following the bre@@ aku@@ p and privatization of Japanese National Railways .
The facility itself is also an active depot ( Umekoji Rail@@ yard ) , and carries out inspec@@ tions and maintenance on steam locomotives and Japanese National Railways Di@@ esel Loc@@ omo@@ tive Class DE@@ 10 owned by Sagano Scenic Railway .
Initially , this facility was established for working preservation of steam locomotives , which had begun dis@@ appearing rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s .
The K@@ oyama eng@@ ine yard at K@@ oyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture was the best candidate for the locomotive preservation area because it was close to the capital , but the Umekoji eng@@ ine yard was chosen in 1970 for its central location in Japan and the presence of other historic spots in the area .
Rev@@ i@@ ew@@ s had been made to sel@@ ect , in principle , low@@ est-@@ numbered extant steam locomotives ( # 1 if possible ) for preservation , but there are some steam locomotives , such as the Class C@@ 62 # 2 , that were not originally planned for preservation .
The facilities consist of the Ste@@ am Loc@@ omo@@ tive Dis@@ play Hall , taking advantage of the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar gar@@ age and tur@@ n@@ table of the former Umekoji Eng@@ ine Depot , and the Educational Dis@@ play G@@ all@@ ery at the former Nijo Station building which was moved and rebuilt at this location .
The sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar gar@@ age of reinforced concrete construction ( built in 1914 ) was designated as an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government on December 10 , 2004 , along with its 5-@@ ton electric ceiling c@@ rane ( completed in 1915 ) and access r@@ ails .
In 2004 , it was also chosen by the Japan Society of Civil Eng@@ ine@@ ers as a Public Works Heritage site .
In 2006 , the former Nijo Station building ( g@@ all@@ ery ) and the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar gar@@ age , along with the preserved steam locomotives as well as inspection and maintenance equipment , etc. were designated as Railway Memorial Ob@@ j@@ ects and Railway Sem@@ i-@@ memorial Ob@@ j@@ ects by JR West Japan .
The former Nijo Station building , built in 1904 by the Kyoto Railway Company to double as a headquarters building , is now the oldest 2-@@ story , wooden , Japanese-style station building , and was modeled after Heian Jingu Shrine with harmon@@ y with the surrounding landscape in mind .
It was used as a station building by Japanese National Railways and JR West Japan after Kyoto Railway Company was nation@@ alized in 1907 ; but its use as a station building ended in 1996 , following the elev@@ ation of the Sanin Line ( Sagano Line ) between Nijo and Hanazono St@@ ations ( in Kyoto Prefecture ) , and in 1997 was rebuilt on this site to be used as an entrance , with its original ind@@ o@@ or facilities such as ticket wind@@ ows being used as a g@@ all@@ ery .
It was designated a Cultural Property of the City of Kyoto in April 1996 .
The sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar gar@@ age houses and dis@@ plays 18 steam locomotives ( originally 17 when the facility first opened ) of 16 different classes - all manufactured in Japan from the Taisho to Showa periods .
When this museum opened , there was a rule that locomotives should be preserved in working conditions . In fact , 15 locomotives excluding the two ( Class C@@ 53 # 45 and Class C@@ 51 # 2@@ 39 ) were registered for operation . However , the s@@ cope of locomotives to be preserved has been re@@ considered several times since then . As of 2006 , 7 locomotives of 7 different classes are preserved in working conditions .
Of those , 5 steam locomotives of 5 different classes are still registered for operation , and 2 ( Class C@@ 57 # 1 and Class C@@ 56 # 16@@ 0 ) are in service to pull trains on main lines such as the Yamaguchi on the Yamaguchi Line and the Kita Biwako on the Hokuriku Main Line .
The others in working conditions are registered but cannot run on the main lines because they have not under@@ gone general inspec@@ tions .
Also , the S@@ L Ste@@ am@@ lin@@ er - pulled by a locomotive being preserved in working conditions for display in the museum - is running on the tracks of the museum site .
This display track once stretched north from the gar@@ age to the northern edge of the grounds , where there is now a parking lot for large vehicles ( where a rest facility for the museum and a park were once located ) . In line with relocation of the former Nijo Station building , it was re@@ arranged to go through the southern edge of Umekoji Park and under the Sagano Line tracks .
Today this is still a func@@ tional eng@@ ine depot , and is connected to rail lines in operation .
After the closing of West Japan Railway Company 's Takat@@ ori Pl@@ ant , the facility has also taken over maintenance of steam locomotives .

St@@ ands for Umekoji
All the steam locomotives , except for Class C@@ 62 # 1 that was designated in 1976 , were designated as Railway Sem@@ i-@@ memorial Ob@@ j@@ ects together with its log@@ s and maintenance tools in 2006 .
Un@@ less otherwise noted , the steam locomotives were transferred from the previous eng@@ ine dep@@ ots in 1972 .
Reg@@ istr@@ a@@ ion of steam locomotives marked with * had been del@@ eted when they were brought to Umekoji for preservation .

Shom@@ yo is one of the traditional forms of Japanese music .
It is a chant of Buddhist scriptures and a religious music for ceremonies .
It is also called Bon@@ bai and Bon@@ n@@ oku in Japanese .
It is written as 聲@@ 明 in the old form .
Shom@@ yo is the name for one of the academic fields ( Gom@@ yo ) of ancient India .
Gom@@ yo refers to five academic fields - Shom@@ yo ( phon@@ ology and gr@@ am@@ m@@ ar ) , Kug@@ yom@@ yo ( techn@@ ics and technology ) , I@@ homyo ( medical science ) , In@@ myo ( eth@@ ics ) and Nai@@ myo ( study of a scholar 's religion , as in Buddhism for a Buddhist ) .
It was introduced to Japan together with Buddhism and became well established .
There is a record that a Buddhist ceremony involving the use of Shom@@ yo was held at the opening ceremony for the Todai-ji Temple Great Buddha E@@ y@@ e in 7@@ 54 , so it is believed that Shom@@ yo flourished during the Nara period .
During the early Heian period , Saicho and Kukai introduced Shom@@ yo and founded Tendai Shom@@ yo and Shingon Shom@@ yo , respectively .
Buddhist sects other than the Tendai-@@ shu and Shing@@ on-@@ shu sects also have their own Shom@@ yo , each of which has been handed down to the present day .
Because Shom@@ yo was passed down by K@@ uden ( handing down from month to ear ) , there was no musical notation .
Therefore , its initi@@ ation was extremely difficult .
Later , Hak@@ ase was invented as an equivalent of musical notation .
There are differences in technical terms ( such as Hak@@ ase ) in each school .
However , Hak@@ ase was a reference to chant , and in order to learn Shom@@ yo , k@@ uden ( also called ro@@ i , or direct initi@@ ation by an instructor ) was necessary ; therefore , conserv@@ ation and inheritance were impossible from the perspective of a master to a disciple .
Therefore , the development of instruc@@ tors and successors was a must .
Num@@ erous schools were ext@@ inguished due to various circumstances .
Tendai Shom@@ yo developed independently , in accordance with what Saicho had introduced .
After Saicho , Ennin and Ann@@ en made it prosperous .
Ry@@ onin , the founder of Yu@@ z@@ un@@ em@@ butsu-@@ shu sect , is known as the patriarch of the Restoration .
In 110@@ 9 , Ry@@ onin built Rai@@ go@@ in Temple ( Sakyo Ward , Kyoto City ) in Ohara , Kyoto .
Rai@@ go@@ in Temple , in Ohara , was called Gyo@@ zan as the temple 's title , having been named after Gyo@@ zan , the birthplace of Shom@@ yo in China .
Before long , Rai@@ go@@ in Temple and Shor@@ inin Temple were known as the do@@ jo@@ s of Ohara School Gyo@@ zan Shom@@ yo .
J@@ ak@@ ugen developed a school later , so there were two schools of Shom@@ yo in Ohara .
Subsequently , Sh@@ ukai restored Ohara Shom@@ yo .
Tan@@ chi established a stream based on a new form of music theory .
Since then , it became the center of Tendai Shom@@ yo , and it has been inherited by the present Tendai Shom@@ yo .
The Yu@@ z@@ un@@ em@@ butsu-@@ shu sect , Jod@@ o-@@ shu sect and Jodo Shinshu sect represent the lineage of Tendai Shom@@ yo .
Shingon Shom@@ yo has been passed down to the present day based on what Kukai introduced .
Shom@@ yo was systemat@@ ized after Shing@@ a .
Particularly , Kan@@ cho was known as the patriarch of the Restoration .
He worked on the composition and control of Shom@@ yo .
There were numerous schools until the Kamakura period , but the prin@@ c@@ ely priest Kaku@@ sho reorganized them into four : the Hon@@ so@@ in@@ ryu School , Shin@@ so@@ in@@ ryu School , Daig@@ or@@ yu School and Nakag@@ awa-@@ Dai@@ shin@@ ryu School .
Shom@@ yo , of the Kog@@ i ( old ) Shing@@ on@@ shu sect , declined and became extinct with the emergence of the Edo period .
The Hon@@ so@@ in@@ ryu School , Shin@@ so@@ in@@ ryu School and Daig@@ or@@ yu School were ext@@ inguished by the middle of the Meiji period .
Currently , it is divided into Chi@@ zan Shom@@ yo ( Chi@@ sh@@ akuin , Kyoto ) , Bu@@ zan Shom@@ yo ( Has@@ e-dera Temple , Nara ) , Nan@@ zan-@@ shin@@ ryu School ( Mt . Koy@@ a-@@ san and Kog@@ i Shing@@ on@@ shu sect temples , Kyoto ) .
Chi@@ zan Shom@@ yo and Bu@@ zan Shom@@ yo ( Shing@@ i ( new ) Shing@@ on@@ shu sect Shom@@ yo ) : Shom@@ yo of Chi@@ zan-@@ ha Buddhi@@ sts , Shing@@ on-@@ shu sect and that of Bu@@ zan-@@ ha Buddhi@@ sts , Shing@@ on-@@ shu sect were originally derived from the Nakag@@ awa-@@ Dai@@ shin@@ ryu School .
Rai@@ yu took in the traditional school of Daigo .
In 1585 , when Negor@@ o-ji Temple ( Wakayama Prefecture ) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and went into decline , the Chi@@ zan and Bu@@ zan schools formed a school based on the traditional school of Daigo .

Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji )
M@@ ale
Empress Suiko ( 6@@ 26 ) - Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) ( January 10 , 672 )
The 3@@ 8th Emperor
Kokufu Shi@@ go is Am@@ em@@ ikoto hir@@ ak@@ as@@ u@@ wake no mikoto / Am@@ atsum@@ ikoto sak@@ iw@@ ake no mikoto
The first name is Kaz@@ ur@@ aki ( Katsuragi ) .
It is presumed that he was once called Kaz@@ ur@@ aki no miko ( Katsuragi no miko ) .
He is generally known as Nak@@ ano Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) .
The " oe " means " prince , " and " Nak@@ ano oe " means " second prince . "
O@@ v@@ erv@@ i@@ ew
He was the second prince of Emperor J@@ ome .
The mother was Tak@@ ara no Himemiko ( later called Empress Kog@@ yoku ) .
The Empress was Yamat@@ ohime no Okimi , daughter of Emperor 's half-brother , Fur@@ uhito no Oe no Miko .
The Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) plotted a rebellion with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and seized power in a coup to kill SOGA no Iruka , by which his uncle Emperor Kotoku came to power and he became a prince .
He established a new er@@ a-@@ -@@ the Tai@@ ka-@@ -@@ and made many reforms during this period ( he was a key person in the Taika reforms and Itsu@@ shi no hen ) .
He devised a plan to tr@@ ap an opposition group that included Arima no Miko , who might have caused a coup in the future , and they were executed .
As Baekje was destroyed by the Silla ( Kingdom ) and Tang in 6@@ 60 , the Baekje prince , Bu@@ yeo P@@ ung , who was staying at the Imperial Court , was sent back to his country to save Baekje .
The Emperor stayed at Tsukushi to send co@@ ver@@ t troops to Baekje , but Empress Sai@@ mei died in 6@@ 61 .
Eventually , the Emperor took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony , but then he was severely defeated in the Battle of Haku@@ suk@@ in@@ oe and moved to Otsu City to be enthroned in 6@@ 63 .
After the Battle of Haku@@ suk@@ in@@ oe a castle surrounded by water was built , and Nor@@ oshi and Sak@@ imori ( the con@@ script soldier system in the old days ) were organized to protect the territory .
Moreover , the system of ranking officials was changed from 19 levels to 26 levels .
In 6@@ 70 the first national family reg@@ istry , " Kog@@ o-@@ nen@@ jaku , " was introduced .
According to " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " the Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) wanted the first prince , Otomo no Miko , to be his successor .
However , after the death of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) his brother , Oama no Miko ( Emperor T@@ em@@ mu ) , defeated Otomo no Miko in the Jinshin War ( the Jinshin Disturbance ) and was enthroned .
Subsequently , Emperor T@@ em@@ mu 's ancest@@ ry remained in power until Empress Shotoku .
After the death of Empress Shotoku , S@@ ir@@ ak@@ abe no Okimi , a grandchild of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was enthroned as Emperor Konin and subsequently Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji 's ) ancest@@ ry stayed in power .
It is said that because Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) took Nuk@@ ata no Okimi away from Oama no Miko ( Emperor T@@ em@@ mu ) , he sent his four daughters to Oama no Miko ( Emperor T@@ em@@ mu ) to become princesses for an exp@@ i@@ ation .
Brief Personal History
Born in 6@@ 26
Rit@@ tai@@ shi ( the ceremony to institute the Crown Prince ) was held on July 15 , 6@@ 45 .
Polit@@ ics began without having an enthronement ceremony August 27 , 6@@ 61 .
The enthronement was held on February 23 , 6@@ 68 .
He died on January 10 , 672 at age 46 .
( According to " Fus@@ o-@@ Ry@@ akki " , he died from an illness , but another explanation that has been offered is that he went missing in the mountains and that Emperor T@@ em@@ mu had him assassinated . )
It was one of the myst@@ eries of the mid-@@ seventh century that Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) did not stay in power for a long time .
Various theories have been suggested in regard to the matter .
This was the consideration for setting up Emperor T@@ em@@ mu 's back@@ bone .
There was an accepted theory that Emperor T@@ em@@ mu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) , but this is denied ; another theory is that Emperor T@@ em@@ mu was A@@ ya no Miko , whom Empress Kog@@ yoku had before she married Emperor Jomei , and that he was an older half-brother of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) .
It is apparent that Emperor T@@ em@@ mu was older than Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) after trac@@ ing back their ages according to the Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji 's ) age at death in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) " and the Emperor T@@ em@@ mu 's age at death in other history books .
The information is consistent in the same historical records , and there are eight to nine years of age difference between the two emperors .
Some people say that Emperor T@@ em@@ mu 's age was pur@@ pos@@ ely fal@@ s@@ ified since it was an emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing fact that the younger brother became the emperor before his older brother even though they are half-@@ brothers with the same mother ; but some arg@@ ue that according to " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " Emperor T@@ em@@ mu 's age was 16 when his father , Emperor Jomei , was enthroned , but it was said that he was 16 when his father died .
Therefore , the Emperor 's real year of birth is 6@@ 14 , according to the Royal Family Tree ( Hon@@ cho-@@ ko@@ in-@@ j@@ oun@@ roku ) .
It was usual to have no successor to the Imperial Throne for some period ( in fact , Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) and Empress Jito , who were in power before and after Emperor T@@ em@@ mu , took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony ) .
Some arg@@ ue that this caused the er@@ rors in their ages .
Some people have said that because " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) " and other indicated history books are edited in different years and they are different in character , they cannot be treated al@@ ike . "
Please refer to the section " The Age of Emperor T@@ em@@ mu . "
There is a theory that the Is@@ shi no Hen was a coup caused by K@@ aru no Miko ( Emperor Kotoku ) , in which Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) lost his position .
It has recently been indicated that Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) and Sog@@ ano Iruka had a relatively good relationship and similar basic policies .
This way there is no reason that Naka no Oe no Oji ( Naka no Oe no Miko ) would have assassinated Iruka .
Because there is fal@@ s@@ ification in the definition of Taika 's reform in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) , " this theory has become apparent .
This theory gets a lot of attention because it can explain Empress Kog@@ yoku 's abdication or the reason that the Soga Family ( except Iruka ) was not dis@@ placed from politics after the coup .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was delayed due to the compl@@ aints against his relationship with women .
This is based on the theory that Emperor Kotoku sent a poem to his wife Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko ( Emperor Tenchi 's ( Tenji ) sister with the same mother ) indicating that Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was having an affair with her , which is contained in " Chronicles of Japan ( Nihon Shoki ) . "
In those days , roman@@ ce and marriage were allowed between half-@@ sisters and brothers from different mo@@ thers but not between half-@@ brothers and sisters from the same mother ; however , in the comic story " Ten@@ jo no ni@@ ji ( The R@@ ain@@ bow in the S@@ ky ) , " by Machi@@ ko SA@@ TO@@ NAKA , it is described that there was a roman@@ ce involving this kind of forbidden love ; Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko was persuaded to marry with K@@ aru no Miko ( Emperor Kotoku ) , but she kept the relationship with Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) , and Arima no Miko was furious after knowing this and became angry at Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko .
There is a theory that Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko ascended the throne as the princess of the previous Emperor but one and became an Empress after the death of Empress Sai@@ mei ; however , for some reason her name was er@@ ased from the record .
In the Man '@@ yoshu ( " The Anthology of My@@ ri@@ ad Leaves ) , " " Nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto " is considered to be Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko , and it is said that the one named " Nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto " was a temporary Emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) .
If Hashi@@ hito no Himemiko was the same person as " Nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto , " there is a question why only she had this special name ; altern@@ atively , it is said that this name could have been for Empress Sai@@ mei , but there is no proof .
It is hard to prove , since this is about political history with limited data ; however , it is expected to have cl@@ ear@@ er information from close study in relation to the f@@ ind@@ ings of arch@@ ae@@ ology .
Poems
The Emperor Tenchi ( Tenji ) was a poet who had four poems in " Man '@@ yoshu ( The Anthology of My@@ ri@@ ad Leaves ) . "
He was respected as the Emperor of the Heian dynasty , and one of his poems is found at the beginning of " One Hundred Waka Poems ( the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tan@@ ka-@@ poems by One Hundred Poets ) . "
I am sitting in the bar@@ n next to a rice field when rice is harvested in the autumn and my kimono sleeves get wet by night de@@ w , as the roof of the bar@@ n is covered with rough@@ -@@ bl@@ aded ha@@ y .
The following poem is from " Man '@@ yoshu ( The Anthology of My@@ ri@@ ad Leaves ) . "
In ancient days , Mt . Kag@@ u-@@ yama loved Mt . U@@ ne@@ b@@ i-@@ yama and fought against Mt . Mim@@ in@@ ashi-@@ yama for love ; there is no doubt we still fight for love between wives , as it has been the same since the age of the gods .
The Saionji Family were court nobility descended from the Fujiwara clan .
The Saionji Family was of the Fujiwara clan Fujiw@@ ara-@@ hok@@ ke Kan@@ in@@ ryu , and the Kak@@ aku ( family rank of court nobility ) was the Seiga Family .
The To@@ in Family and Imadegawa / Kik@@ utei Family were branch families of the Saionji Family .
There was a samurai famil@@ y-@@ -@@ the Saionji clan in I@@ yo-@@ no-@@ kun@@ i-@@ -@@ as a major off@@ shoot that used the Saionji surname .
The family crest is Hid@@ ari-@@ mit@@ su@@ dom@@ oe .
The pro@@ gen@@ itor of the Saionji Family was FUJIWARA no Michi@@ sue , the third son of FUJIWARA no Kim@@ izane .
Kint@@ sune SAIONJI , who was a great grandson of Michi@@ sue , was confined by the imperial court during the Jok@@ yu-@@ no-@@ ran War because , having married the niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo , he was being watched over as a relative of the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) ; after the war , however , Kint@@ sune gained the confidence of the shogunate , wi@@ elded the real power in the imperial court through holding the office of Kanto M@@ oshi@@ tsugi , and rose to the position of Daijo daijin ( grand minister of state ) , raising the social standing of the Saionji Family .
The family name of Saionji comes from the name of the temple Kint@@ sune built at Bet@@ tei , in Kyoto ( Kit@@ ayama-@@ so , Kad@@ on@@ o-gun , Yamashi@@ ro@@ -no-@@ kuni ) .
This hall is also called Kit@@ ayama-@@ dono Palace , and the current Kink@@ aku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA after he was given this land by the Saionji Family .
Since the generation of Kint@@ sune , the Saionji Family gained support from the Kamakura shogunate and came to power that sur@@ passed the sek@@ ke throughout the Kamakura era .
San@@ ekane SAIONJI approached Daikaku-ji through genealogy and made his daughters marry Kameyama ho-@@ ou , the ex-@@ emperor , or the Emperor Godaigo .
However , since the generation of San@@ ekane 's son Kin@@ hira SAIONJI , the Saionji Family this time supported the Jim@@ yoin-@@ to genealogy when the Daik@@ akuji-@@ to genealogy started to keep a distance from the bakufu , thereby deep@@ ening the conflict with the Daik@@ akuji-@@ to genealogy .
Thereafter , at the generation of Kin@@ m@@ une SAIONJI , the Saionji Family was dismissed from the post of Kanto M@@ oshi@@ tsugi after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate .
Kin@@ m@@ une har@@ bor@@ ed Yasu@@ ie HOJO , who was a remn@@ ant of the Hojo clan , the assassinated Emperor Godaigo , who had started Ken@@ m@@ u-no-@@ shin@@ sei ; plotted a rebellion to back the ex-@@ emperor G@@ of@@ ushim@@ i of Jim@@ yoin-@@ to genealogy ; and was arrested and executed , the plot having been exposed by the betrayal of Kin@@ m@@ une 's younger brother , Kin@@ shige SAIONJI .
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts , Kin@@ m@@ une 's son Sanet@@ oshi SAIONJI served Hoku@@ cho ( Japan ) and rose to the post of minister of the right , whereby the family name was restored .
During the Muromachi and Edo periods the Saionji Family was also known for having biwa ( Japanese lute ) players as a family business .
In the early days of the Edo period , Sane@@ haru SAIONJI welcomed Toku@@ hime , who was the eldest daughter of Ky@@ um@@ u NAGA@@ OKA ( also known as Tadataka HOSOKAWA ) , as the Mid@@ ai@@ dokoro ( wife of a shogun or a high@@ est-@@ ranking nobleman ) of the heir ( later dis@@ inherited ) of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA , and invited her to accept the post of Sadaijin ( minister of the left ) ; moreover , Ky@@ um@@ u NAGA@@ OKA offered various forms of financial support to the Saionji family , including don@@ ating a property that yi@@ elded 600 koku of rice ( Men@@ ko-@@ sh@@ uro@@ ku ) .
At the end of the Edo period , Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Tok@@ udai@@ ji Family of the same kan@@ in@@ ryu , worked as a politician after the Meiji Restoration , served as prime minister , and had great influence as a gen@@ ro on the political scene during the Taisho and Showa eras .
There is an anecdote that Kinmochi was not good at playing the biwa Japanese lute , which should have been the family business of the Saionji Family , and during Kinmochi 's time in office as prime minister , the Emperor Meiji said out of mis@@ chief to Kinmochi , " For the first time in a long while , I would like to listen to biwa Japanese lute , " and therefore he was forced to play the biwa Japanese lute in di@@ re dist@@ ress together with the officials of U@@ tar@@ yo in the Imperial Household Ministry .
Mt . Hiei is a mountain that str@@ add@@ les the western part of Otsu City in Shiga Prefecture and the nor@@ theastern part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture .
Mt . Hiei is the name for the Soji ridge , which is formed by two pe@@ ak@@ s : Dai@@ hi@@ ei ( 8@@ 4@@ 8.@@ 3@@ m ) on the border between Otsu City and Kyoto City 's Sakyo Ward ; and Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake in Sakyo Ward ( 8@@ 3@@ 8@@ m ) .
Dai@@ hi@@ ei 's first-@@ order triang@@ ulation point is located in Otsu City .
Next to Mt . Koya , it has long been an object of religious belief , flour@@ ishing with Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine on it .
It is part of the Higashiyama mountains ( Kyoto Prefecture ) .
It is also known as Eizan , Hoku@@ rei , Tend@@ ai@@ san , Miyak@@ of@@ uji , etc .
O@@ v@@ erv@@ i@@ ew
Because of its location near the Kim@@ on gate on the northeast side of Kyoto , Mt . Hiei is considered a castle guardian .
The Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) calls Mt . Hiei ' Hi@@ en@@ oyama ' , and records that Oyam@@ aku@@ i no kami is enshrined on Hi@@ en@@ oyama in Omi Province , and Nar@@ ik@@ ab@@ ura is the object of worship .
E@@ ver since Enryaku-ji Temple was founded on Hi@@ en@@ oyama , Oyam@@ aku@@ i no kami , as the god of the land , has been a guardian deity of the Tendai Sect and Enryaku-ji Temple ; and a mountain@@ -@@ king sect based on him has spread in the area .
Also , it is the mountain where Enryaku-ji Temple 's Th@@ ous@@ and-@@ Day C@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ am@@ bul@@ ation Pract@@ ice is done , including a pilgrimage to the shrines at the peak of Mt . Hiei , and to Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at its foot .
Hik@@ ing is popular , and a famous tr@@ ail begins at Shugakuin in Sakyo Ward of Kyoto City and goes up Kir@@ ar@@ az@@ aka hill ; another one on the Shiga Prefecture side begins in Mon@@ zen@@ machi , Sakamoto ( Otsu City ) , and goes up through M@@ ud@@ oj@@ id@@ ani valley .
The path on Kir@@ ar@@ az@@ aka hill has long been used by monks , monk soldiers and imperial messengers traveling between Kyoto and Enryaku-ji Temple , and is still visited by many hik@@ ers today .
The Tokaido N@@ ature T@@ rail passes through the mountain on the way from Otsu to Kyoto / Ohara .
Many tourists come on holidays , since they can reach the top via t@@ oll road , c@@ able car , and ro@@ pe@@ way .
There used to be a Mt . Hiei Am@@ usement Park and a Mt . Hiei Ar@@ ti@@ ficial S@@ ki Sl@@ ope , but both were closed before 2002 ; the site of the s@@ ki slope is now a cos@@ mo@@ s flower garden , and there is an art museum - Hiei Garden Museum - on the former location of the am@@ usement park .
There was also a Forest Land Am@@ usement Park in Y@@ ase , at the foot of the mountain on the Kyoto side , although that was closed on November 30 , 2001 , and a memb@@ er@@ s-@@ only resort hotel now stands in that location .
Dai@@ hi@@ ei and Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake
The survey f@@ ind@@ ings from the Ge@@ ographical Sur@@ v@@ ey Institute show the eastern peak as Dai@@ hi@@ ei , the western peak as Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake , and both of them together as Mt . Hiei .
According to " Ten no Ki " ( The Record of Sur@@ v@@ ey ) , the first-@@ order triang@@ ulation point on the eastern peak is called " Mt . Hiei " .
Although this mar@@ ker is located at the border between Otsu and Kyoto cities , it is inside Otsu City .
When one views Mt . Hiei from the Kyoto basin , it is difficult to see the Dai@@ hi@@ ei peak , so some think that Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake is the peak of Mt . Hiei .
The Keifuku Electric Railroad Eizan R@@ op@@ e@@ way has its Hiei Moun@@ tain@@ top Station placed on the Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake peak .
There are confl@@ ic@@ ting opinions as to the proper way to write and read " Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake " ; the G@@ S@@ I lists Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake / Shim@@ e@@ id@@ ake , while " Place Names of Kyoto " lists Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake and Shim@@ yo no Mine .
Mt . Hiei gets its alternate names , Mt . Tendai and Shim@@ e@@ ig@@ atake , from Mt . Ti@@ ant@@ ai and Mt . S@@ im@@ ing , sacred mountains in the People 's Republic of China that have associations with the Tendai Sect .

The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road ( a game )
The " 53 stations " of the Tokaido Road refers to 53 stations in ' Tokaido Road , ' which is the major road running through the Tokaido region and is among five provinces and seven circ@@ u@@ its ( Gok@@ ishi@@ chi@@ do ) .
Many of the 53 stations are established in places where the scenery is beautiful , or in famous historic spots , and often served as the subjects of uki@@ yoe or waka / haiku .
Furthermore , when it is called 53 stations it refers to the road up to Kyoto , but when referring to the road up to Osaka the term 57 stations is used .
From here on@@ ward we will categor@@ ize them according to their respective provinces .

According to one theory , Ieyasu TOKUGAWA set the number of stations from Edo ( Kanji characters with the same sound , 穢@@ 土 , meaning un@@ clean land ) to Kyo ( which means the land where F@@ ugen Bosatsu ( 普@@ 賢@@ 菩@@ 薩 ) lives ) , based on a chapter from Keg@@ on-@@ kyo Sutra , in which Zen@@ z@@ ai-@@ doshi ( 善@@ 財@@ 童@@ 子 ) of ' N@@ yu@@ hok@@ kai@@ bon ( 入@@ 法@@ 界@@ 品 ) , ' following the orders of Monju Bosatsu , achieved enlightenment at the place of F@@ ugen Bosatsu , through 53 teachers .
As an extension of the Tokaido Road , the stations of the Kyok@@ aido Road ( Osaka Kaido Road ) were established in 16@@ 19 .
In some cases the stations of the Kyok@@ aido Road are included and are collectively referred to as the 57 stations of the Tokaido Road .
Furthermore , when entering the Kyok@@ aido Road from the Tokaido Road , Sanjo-@@ Ohashi Bridge will not be crossed , and the route taken will turn southwest at Hig@@ ec@@ hay@@ a-@@ o@@ iw@@ ake ( 髭@@ 茶@@ 屋@@ 追@@ 分 ) ( O@@ iw@@ ak@@ e-cho , Otsu City ) , so the station following Otsu@@ -@@ juku Station will be Fushimi-@@ juku Station .
These will be categorized according to their respective provinces .
The first number is based on the country .
The second number is a s@@ erial number , starting with Shin@@ agawa-@@ juku Station .
54 . Fushimi-@@ juku Station ( Kyo Kaido Road ) ( Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture )
55 . Yodo-@@ juku Station ( Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture )
56 . Hir@@ ak@@ ata-@@ juku Station ( Hir@@ akata City , Osaka Prefecture )
57 . M@@ orig@@ uchi-@@ shuku Station ( M@@ orig@@ uchi City , Osaka Prefecture )
Kor@@ ai-@@ bashi Bridge ( Chuo Ward , Osaka City , Osaka Prefecture )
Note : It was formerly Kyobashi Bridge ( a bridge over N@@ ey@@ agawa-@@ river , which is located between the Chuo and Miyak@@ oj@@ ima W@@ ards of Osaka City , Osaka Prefecture ) .
" The P@@ illow Book " is a zu@@ i@@ hitsu essay ( literally , " ran@@ dom j@@ ot@@ tings " ) , which is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon , a female writer who lived in the mid-Heian period .
The title was also written using Chinese characters such as ' 枕@@ 草@@ 紙 ' ( Mak@@ ur@@ az@@ oshi Not@@ eb@@ ook ) , ' 枕@@ 冊@@ 子 ' ( Makura Sas@@ shi ) , ' 枕@@ 双@@ 紙 ' ( Makura s@@ oshi ) , and ' 春@@ 曙@@ 抄 ' ( Shun@@ sho-@@ sho Commentary ) , and the oldest manuscript ( called " ma@@ ed@@ ab@@ on " in Japanese ) , a copy of which was made in the Kamakura period , has a g@@ old-@@ lacquered cas@@ ket with the Chinese characters " 清@@ 少@@ 納@@ 言@@ 枕@@ 草@@ 子 " ( Sei Shonagon , The P@@ illow Book ) written on it .
It was also called " Sei Shonagon ki . "
Together with " The Tale of Genji , " this book is considered one of the tw@@ in masterpieces of Heian literature , and it had a great influence on the R@@ enga ( linked verse ) , Hai@@ kai ( sevent@@ een-@@ syllable verse ) , and Kan@@ az@@ oshi ( old stories wit@@ ten in the kana script ) that followed .
Along with both " Hoj@@ o-@@ ki ( The Ten@@ -@@ F@@ o@@ ot@@ -@@ Squ@@ are H@@ ut ) , " written by KAMO no Ch@@ omei , and " Tsure@@ zu@@ reg@@ usa ( Es@@ says in I@@ d@@ l@@ eness ) " written by Ken@@ ko YOSHIDA , it is called one of the three Japanese major lists , histories and sat@@ ires .
Its writing style is extremely individ@@ u@@ alistic : there is no similar book except " G@@ iz@@ an-@@ z@@ ass@@ an ( G@@ izan Collection ) , " compiled by Shang@@ yin L@@ I ( courtesy name Y@@ ish@@ an ) , a poet of the late Tang dynasty .
According to an after@@ word to the book , her mo@@ tive for writing the book and the origin of the title came from the episode in which , when Naidaijin ( minister of the center ) FUJIWARA no Korechika presented to his younger sister FUJIWARA no Empress Teishi and Emperor Ichijo a bund@@ le of paper , which was still expensive in those days , the Empress inqu@@ ired , ' Emperor used the paper to copy " Shiki ( Records of the Grand Histor@@ ian ) , ' what do you think we could write on this ? " to which Sei Shonagon answered , ' it ( the book ) would be good to use as a pill@@ ow . '
She was granted the paper ( such episode being based on San@@ kan@@ bon ( version of manuscript ) , and both in@@ complete and complete versions of No@@ in@@ bon ( version of manuscript ) have similar episodes describing the response that " it ( the book ) would be good to use as a pill@@ ow ) , " but the Sakai@@ bon and Ma@@ ed@@ ab@@ on ( versions of the manuscript ) don 't contain this episode ) .
It is widely thought that the title ' The P@@ illow Book ' is also based on the episode .
" A study of the P@@ illow Book " written by Kazu@@ hiko HAYASHI mentions his own view and some other past scholars ' names such as Ke@@ ichu , Shin@@ obu O@@ RI@@ KU@@ CHI , and Kik@@ an IKEDA .
The following are typical views about the meaning of " pill@@ ow " :
― B@@ ed@@ ding : a p@@ un that suggests a pill@@ ow on the m@@ att@@ ress ( with Shiki rew@@ orded as Shiki@@ but@@ on ( m@@ att@@ ress ) ) .
― D@@ ic@@ tionary for the writer : There are many chapters in which Ut@@ am@@ akura ( a place fam@@ ed in poetry ) , rules , and terms are listed .
― M@@ emor@@ and@@ um : She kept the paper by her pill@@ ow for private j@@ ot@@ tings .
― Treas@@ ured book
― Ir@@ relevant to anything
However , scholars have yet to reach a con@@ sen@@ sus .
Also , in the book of " Eiga monogatari ( A Tale of Flow@@ ering Fort@@ un@@ es ) , " the term ' m@@ akura no s@@ oshi ' as a common n@@ oun was used to describe the beautiful kas@@ ane ( lay@@ ering ) colors .
According to the after@@ word , the first draft was written around 99@@ 6 , and Sach@@ ujo ( guard of the Imperial Palace ) MINAMOTO no Tsun@@ efusa took the draft from the author 's residence and brought it before the eyes of the world .
After that , she wrote continuously , and some records say the book was written around 10@@ 12 .
Some lines of " The P@@ illow Book , " as quoted from the old commentary " Shim@@ ei-@@ sho Commentary of ' The Tale of Genji , ' " don 't exist in the surviving manuscript , which suggests that the writing process was complicated .
There are great differences between the existing manuscripts .
It consists of three volumes and takes the form of a collection of various writings .
It is a manuscript containing an ok@@ ug@@ aki ( post@@ script ) written in 12@@ 28 by a person called B@@ og@@ yug@@ uo , who seems to have been FUJIWARA no Sadaie .
It is ' clear writing ' and is easy to understand , being considered the most similar to the original form .
It was divided into two groups by Kik@@ an IKEDA .
Kor@@ ui ( first class ) - The opening 70 chapters , which start with the line , ' The best time in spring is dawn , ' are omitted , and instead the manuscript begins with the line , ' Com@@ for@@ table thing . '
2@@ 30 chapters
Book collection of Yomei pap@@ er@@ back , book collection of To@@ shoryo , Shor@@ yo Department , Imperial Household Agency , and book collection of the Tat@@ amat@@ sunomiya fa@@ am@@ ily

Old book collection of Ham@@ ao YA@@ TOMI , book collection of Kar@@ iya City Library , old book collection of the Date family , old book collection of the KAJUJI Family , old book collection of Ak@@ ika NAKAMURA , book collection of Koshi@@ do Bunko
The priest No@@ in was related by marriage to Sei Shonagon ( one of his sisters was a wife of TACHIBANA no Norinaga , a son of Sei Shonagon ) , and seemed to have something to do with handing down the manuscript .
The date of the work has been traced back to the end of the Kamakura period .
After argu@@ ing which book is more auth@@ entic , it is now widely accepted that the original book of No@@ in@@ bon is inferior to San@@ kan@@ bon .
Two hundred and thirty chapters ( excluding the first 70 chapters )
300 chapters
Ru@@ isan form ( a classified collection in book form )
Man@@ uscrip@@ t copied in the Muromachi period
The post@@ script says KIYOHARA no Shig@@ ekata / Ed@@ akata copied the book , whose owner was Do@@ ha , a secluded monk who lived in Sakai , and therefore the manuscript is called Sakai@@ bon .
Two volumes
The book is missing chapters on diary and remin@@ isc@@ ence .
Gok@@ og@@ on@@ in@@ bon ( type of manuscript ) : 19@@ 0 chapters
The post@@ script says Emperor Go-@@ Kogon made a copy of the book .
Shin@@ kan@@ bon ( a manuscript in the Emperor 's own hand )
Nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five chapters
The above two types of manuscripts were integrated into a book .
Sakai@@ bon in general refers to this .
Volume 1 consists of 10@@ 7 chapters .
Volume 2 consists of 89 chapters .
Volume 3 consists of 10@@ 2 chapters .
Volume 4 consists of 32 chapters .
Volume 5 might have been lost .
It takes Ru@@ isan form .
There exists only one manuscript that has been handed down in the Maeda family of Kaga Province ( the book collection of MAE@@ DA@@ -@@ Ik@@ ut@@ ok@@ ukai ) .
It is preserved in a box of g@@ old-@@ lacquered craft , and on its surface are the characters " 清@@ 少@@ 納@@ 言@@ 枕@@ 草@@ 子 ( Sei Shonagon , The P@@ illow Book ) " in gold inc@@ ru@@ station .
It is an important cultural property .
It was copied during the early Kamakura period and is considered to be the oldest of all the manuscripts of " The P@@ illow Book . "
Among them , the Sakai@@ bon group Gok@@ og@@ on@@ in@@ bon was separately collected in two volumes of " Gun@@ shor@@ u@@ iju ( Japanese history book ) , " and three kinds of Sakai@@ bon were collected in " Shinko Gun@@ shor@@ u@@ iju ( library ) . "
Additionally , No@@ in@@ bon was used as a master copy in making the old plate of type in the early Edo period ; therefore , it remained a dominant manuscript along with " The P@@ illow Book Bo@@ chu ( mar@@ g@@ inal notes ) " and " Shun@@ sho-@@ sho Commentary of The P@@ illow Book " ( anno@@ tated by K@@ ig@@ in KI@@ TAMURA ) until modern times .
However , in 1946 , when J@@ utaro TANAKA ( 19@@ 17@@ -@@ 1987 ) re@@ evaluated the second class of San@@ kan@@ bon , it came to be considered more important and was published more , being used as a text@@ book and read at school after the war .
Other existent manuscripts are seven chapters of " The P@@ illow Book E@@ kotoba ( story in pictures ) " made in the late Kamakura period , consisting of emaki ( a picture scroll ) with haku@@ b@@ yo@@ ga ( ink line painting ) , and San@@ kan@@ bon manuscript seems to have been used for the notes .
The second-@@ class San@@ kan@@ bon contains more than 300 independent chapters in total .
It consists of various types of writing : ' chapters of Ruiju ' of ' Mon@@ ow@@ azuk@@ ushi ( en@@ um@@ er@@ ating the things in the same category ) , ' as represented by the lists of things like ' In@@ sects , ' ' Flow@@ ering trees , ' ' Dis@@ pir@@ iting things , ' ' En@@ d@@ ear@@ ingly lov@@ ely things , ' and ' Chap@@ ters of Zu@@ iso ( essay ) , ' which is an observation of daily life and nature in the seasons , and ' chapters of remin@@ isc@@ ence ( chapters of a diary ) ' in which the author wrote about the life around Empress Teishi , whom she served in the Imperial Court .
However , some chapters are too ob@@ sc@@ ure to be classified ( for example the first chapter , entitled , ' The best time in spring is dawn , ' is generally classified into the chapters of Zu@@ iso , but some people dis@@ agree ) .
It was written in the plain v@@ ern@@ ac@@ ular using Hir@@ ag@@ ana ( the Japanese cur@@ sive syllabary ) , and most of the chapters were written in a wit@@ ty style , but sometimes sen@@ tim@@ ental lam@@ entation appears reflec@@ ting the fall of the Michitaka FUJIWARA 's family and un@@ happiness gone through by her maj@@ esty Empress Teishi .
The author 's sophisticated taste was in harmon@@ y with a ke@@ en observation on things , gener@@ ating the intellect@@ ual aes@@ thetic world of ' w@@ ok@@ ashi ( am@@ using or del@@ ight@@ ful ) ' in contrast with the emo@@ tional ' mono no aware ( path@@ os ) ' of " The Tale of Genji . "
Pos@@ itive evaluation
In The P@@ illow Book , the author ch@@ eri@@ shed hum@@ an@@ ity as well as nature ; therefore , she accepted and formed them in each phase as various be@@ au@@ ties ( Saku@@ wo ME@@ KATA ) .
Even in each chapter , various types of rich writing such as lists , ess@@ ays or remin@@ isc@@ ences are freely inter@@ woven , like a flying horse so@@ ar@@ ing into the sky with a str@@ and of associations called up one after another . ( B@@ oku HA@@ GI@@ TANI )
Although it followed the conventional ' spring - flower -@@ morning ' type of lin@@ k that was often seen in Kok@@ inshu in those days , its use of the ' seas@@ on-@@ time ' type of expression ( such as ' the best time in spring is dawn ' ) , which omitted the middle poetic element , was innov@@ ative , challeng@@ ing as it did the rig@@ id es@@ thetic values held by readers who were familiar with poetic traditions . ( Mun@@ etoshi FUJI@@ MOTO )
She expressed her love and respect for Empress Teishi .
The author wrote it to con@@ sole Empress Teishi , who felt de@@ pressed over the fall of the Michitaka family .
Therefore , it is natural that she didn 't mention the fall of the Michitaka family ( as above ) .
There are some chapters that seem like mere self-@@ praise , but in them the author claimed that the Empress and the people around her received the Emperor 's favor and led a life filled with aes@@ thetic senti@@ ment and ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite taste , living in a world that was cut off from the politics of the time and dis@@ appointment . ( Os@@ amu UE@@ NO ) .
Neg@@ ative evaluation
It is a represent@@ ation of her sh@@ allow@@ ness trying to forget her original social rank and ass@@ imil@@ ate herself to the upper class . ( Ken AKI@@ YAMA )
( It is based on the fact that she didn 't use polit@@ e expressions when she wrote , not only about her family but also about those who belonged to the upper classes . )
It is only ' a record of civilization in the inner palace , ' and wasn 't written by ' a private individual ' ( J@@ oji ISHIDA ) .
Yoshinobu ( Yoshihisa ) TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun of the Edo Shogunate ( held the position from December 5 , 1866 to December 9 , 1867 , both in the old lunar calendar ) .
He was the only Shogun who did not work in Edo-jo Castle .
His rank awarded by the Imperial Court was Naidaijin ( Inner Minister ) J@@ u-@@ ichii Kun@@ -@@ it@@ to Ko@@ shaku .
He was a member of the House of Peers of Japan .
He served as the guardian ( Shogun Kok@@ en@@ shoku ) of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA ; after Iemochi 's death he assumed his position as the 15th Shogun of the Edo Shogunate .
After he returned his right to ad@@ minister government to Emperor Meiji ( Taisei Hokan ) , he worked aiming to un@@ ite the nobles and samurai ( Kobu G@@ att@@ ai ) ; however , during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that took place after the Restoration of Imperial Rule ( O@@ sei Fuk@@ ko ) , he left the Shogunate army behind at Osaka-jo Castle and returned to Edo-jo Castle ; thereafter , he received a subjugation order from the Imperial Court and entered into discipl@@ inary confinement which led to the B@@ lo@@ od@@ less Sur@@ rend@@ er of Edo-jo Castle .
After being fre@@ ed from the discipl@@ inary confinement , he im@@ mer@@ sed himself in his hob@@ b@@ ies ; he was awarded the title of Ko@@ shaku and lived into the Taisho Period .
The name " Yoshinobu " is also pop@@ ularly read as " Kei@@ ki " ( Yus@@ oku-@@ y@@ omi , the way of pron@@ oun@@ c@@ ing in the Chinese-@@ derived reading , so as not to directly pron@@ oun@@ ce the real name of the resp@@ ec@@ table person in the Japanese reading ) .
There is a record among official documents of the Edo Shogunate that during his ten@@ ure as the Shogun his name was also read as " Yoshihisa " .
There are also records of his name written as " Yoshihisa " with his own signature using Roman letters , and [ his name printed as " Yoshihisa " ] in newspapers in English .
He is most often called " Yoshinobu " in his hom@@ el@@ and of Mito , but he is often called " Kei@@ ki " in Shizuoka , where he spent the rest of his life .
According to those who knew him in his lifetime , Yoshinobu himself liked to be called " Kei@@ ki-@@ sama " , and he called himself " Kei@@ ki " in a t@@ eleg@@ raph sent to his younger brother , Akit@@ ake TOKUGAWA .
Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA , who was Yoshinobu 's heir , was also called " Kei@@ ky@@ u-@@ sama " from those around him .
The use of the two names " Kei@@ ki-@@ sama " and " Kei@@ ki-@@ san " has been confirmed , and even though it seems to have become un@@ common in the modern days , the use of " Kei@@ ki-@@ san " is not limited to Shizuoka but is confirmed in various regions ; in both cases the name is often used with much affection .
Though Ryot@@ aro SHIBA commented that " the name ' Kei@@ ki ' was used quite often among those associated with the former Shogunate " , the use of the name " Kei@@ ki " was also confirmed among those related to Hig@@ o-@@ han Clan who worked toward the fall of the Shogunate ; there is a possibility that he was widely yet secretly respected and admired .
He was born at the Mit@@ o-@@ han Clan residence of Ko@@ ishi@@ kawa in Edo , as the seventh son of the ninth chief [ of Mit@@ o-@@ han Clan ] , Nari@@ aki TOKUGAWA on September 29 , 18@@ 37 .
His mother was [ his father 's ] legitimate wife , Princess Yoshiko ( he was the first Shogun since the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA whose biological mother was the father 's legitimate wife .
However , although Iemitsu 's biological mother is officially known as the father Hidetada 's legitimate wife , O@@ go no K@@ ata , but one theory suggests that his biological mother was Kasuga no Tsubone ) .
His childhood name was Shichi@@ ro@@ m@@ aro .
Based on Nari@@ aki 's educational policy , " a boy should be educated in his home domain " Yoshinobu moved to Mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family , during which time he was educated and taught martial arts by Se@@ ishi@@ sai A@@ I@@ ZAWA .
Yoshinobu 's intellig@@ ence was noted early ; at first , instead of sending him to another family for adoption , Nari@@ aki planned to keep him by his eldest son and heir , Yoshi@@ atsu TOKUGAWA 's side .
On August 1 , 184@@ 7 , the Shogunate gave a secret order to design@@ ate Shichi@@ ro@@ m@@ aro of Mit@@ o-@@ han Clan as the heir to the Hitotsubashi Family , one of the three branches of the Tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ han Clan ( Gos@@ ankyo ) .
Acc@@ ep@@ ting this order , Shichi@@ ro@@ m@@ aro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Family on September 1 ; in December , he received Hen@@ ki ( one character of Shogun 's name : 慶 ) from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi ( 家@@ 慶 ) TOKUGAWA and changed his name to Yoshinobu ( 慶@@ 喜 ) .
Considering Yoshinobu as a strong candidate as the heir to the Shogun , Ieyoshi visited the Hitotsubashi Residence often , but he abandoned this idea after accepting Roju Masahiro ABE 's ad@@ mon@@ ishing advice .
During the disorder caused by the Ar@@ rival of the Black Shi@@ ps , Shogun Ieyoshi died in 1853 ; his heir , the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , had poor health with no pro@@ sp@@ ect of having his own son , and therefore the issue of " who would become the Shogun 's heir " arose ( Is@@ sue of Shogun 's H@@ eir ) .
There was an opposition between the Hitotsub@@ ashi-@@ party that included Nari@@ aki , Masahiro ABE and the Chief of Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan , Nari@@ akira SHIMAZU , who recommended Yoshinobu , and the Nan@@ ki-@@ party primarily consisting of the Chief of Hik@@ one-@@ han Clan , Naosuke II , and the O@@ oku members headed by Iesada 's bir@@ th-@@ mother , Hon@@ juin , who recommended the Chief of Ki@@ i-@@ han Clan , Yoshit@@ omi TOKUGAWA .
The Hitotsub@@ ashi-@@ party executed political maneu@@ vers such as sending into O@@ oku Nari@@ akira SHIMAZU 's adopted daughter , Ten@@ shoin , as Shogun 's wife ( Mid@@ ai@@ dokoro ) , but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nari@@ akira SHIMAZU , its power weakened ; Naosuke II who became Tairo in 1858 settled on " Shogun 's heir as Yoshit@@ omi TOKUGAWA " through arbit@@ ration .
In the same year , Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without the Emperor 's permission .
Yoshinobu , along with Nari@@ aki and the Chief of Fuku@@ i-@@ han Clan , Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA , made an un@@ expected visit to the [ Edo-jo ] castle and closely inter@@ rog@@ ated Naosuke , but in tern , he was questioned on his off@@ ense of making an un@@ expected visit to the castle ; he was ordered to retire and was given a discipl@@ inary confinement in the following year ( 1859 ) ( Ansei Pur@@ ge ) .
Yoshinobu himself seemed to be un@@ interested in becoming the heir to the Shogun and he sent a letter to Nari@@ aki whose content indicated " I appreci@@ ate your efforts but I '@@ d rather not become the Shogun than to make mist@@ akes after becoming the Shogun . "
He was reli@@ eved from his discipl@@ inary confinement in 1860 .
In 1862 , guarded by the Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan army under the command of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , the Emperor 's messenger , Shig@@ et@@ omi O@@ HARA , entered Edo and delivered Emperor Komei 's order to " promote Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA to the Shogun 's guardian ( Shogun Kok@@ en@@ shoku ) and Shun@@ gaku ( Yoshinaga ) MATSUDAIRA to Tairo . "
On July 6 , the Shogunate ordered Yoshinobu to be the Shogun 's guardian ( Shogun Kok@@ en@@ shoku ) and Shun@@ gaku to be the Shogunal Prime Minister ( Sei@@ ji Sos@@ ai@@ shoku ) .
Yoshinobu and Shun@@ gaku directed a reform of the Shogunate known as the Bun@@ kyu Reform that included install@@ ation of The Office of Kyoto Pro@@ tec@@ tor ( Kyoto Sh@@ ugo@@ shoku ) and rel@@ ax@@ ation of San@@ kin Kot@@ ai requi@@ rement .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as Iemochi TOKUGAWA 's har@@ b@@ inger , and he ende@@ av@@ ored to negoti@@ ate with the members of the Imperial Court who urged the execution of Joi ( expulsion of foreigners from Japan ) .
Upon Emperor Komei 's visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the execution of Joi , if Iemochi received Set@@ to ( Emperor 's sword that symbol@@ ically author@@ izes the Shogun to take charge of the up@@ coming battle on behalf of the Emperor ) from the Emperor , he would have no choice but to exec@@ ute Joi ; Yoshinobu quickly made Iemochi canc@@ el the audience [ with the Emperor ] by saying that Iemochi had a cold and a f@@ ever ( pre@@ tended illness ) .
When the Sonno Joi party ( the anti-@@ foreign@@ er R@@ oy@@ alists ) centered around the Cho@@ shu-@@ han Clan lost their case upon the political change on August 18 , Yoshinobu went to Kyoto again in order to participate in a meeting jointly held by the party trying to un@@ ite the nobles and samurai ( Kobu G@@ att@@ ai ) and the party assist@@ ing the Shogunate ( Sab@@ aku ) .
However , when no agreement was reached , he used a b@@ old method of negotiation ; he intentionally got drunk at a banquet with Prince Kuni Asa@@ hiko and rev@@ iled at Mun@@ enari DATE , Shun@@ gaku MATSUDAIRA and Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , and furthermore , viol@@ ently said to Nak@@ agawa no Miya , " how much is SHIMAZU paying you ! " so as to break@@ down their organization .
Thereafter , he remained in Kyoto and he was appointed to Kin@@ ri Go@@ shu@@ ei Sot@@ oku ( Head of the Imperial Palace / Emperor 's Pro@@ tec@@ tor ) ; together with the Pro@@ tec@@ tor ( Sh@@ ugo@@ shoku ) Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( A@@ izu-@@ han Clan ) and Kyoto Shoshidai Sada@@ aki MATSUDAIRA ( Chief of Ku@@ wan@@ a-@@ han Clan ) regulated the nobles and those loyal to the Emperor ( Ichi@@ -@@ Kai-@@ So ( Hitotsub@@ ashi-@@ A@@ izu-@@ Kuwana ) structure ) .
During the Tenguto War he showed his cru@@ el@@ ty by sl@@ a@@ shing his supporters such as K@@ oun@@ sai TAKEDA and the vassals of his home domain of Mito .
At the Kinmon Rebellion in 1864 he led the Shogunate army and he himself attacked the Choshu army that had occupied the Takatsuk@@ asa Residence .
After the First Sub@@ jug@@ ation of Choshu that followed , he made every effort to secure the Emperor 's permission on the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Un@@ ites States and Japan that had been left un@@ authorized by the Emperor ; he succeeded in sec@@ uring the Emperor 's author@@ ization al@@ be@@ it with prov@@ is@@ os .
At the Second Sub@@ jug@@ ation of Choshu in 1866 , Yoshinobu suppressed inter@@ fer@@ ences from Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan and received a direct order from the Emperor to subjugate Choshu .
However , because of the Satsum@@ a-@@ Choshu Alliance ( S@@ ac@@ cho Alliance ) , Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan refused to send its army and consequently the Shogunate army had to retreat .
During the Second Sub@@ jug@@ ation of Choshu , Shogun Iemochi passed away at Osaka-jo Castle on July 20 .
Yoshinobu appealed to the Imperial Court to make an official announcement of tru@@ ce by the Emperor and he succeeded in con@@ cluding an arm@@ ist@@ ice treaty .
He was recommended to be Iemochi 's successor but Yoshinobu firmly declined .
He succeeded to the Tokugawa Shogun Family on Au@@ g . 20 but he continued to ref@@ use to assume his position as the Shogun .
Since then the roju ( Shogun 's political advisor ) and others sinc@@ er@@ ely requested him to become the Shogun , but he still did not accept the request ; he finally assumed his position as the Shogun on December 5 , after accepting ( Emperor Komei 's ) direct order to become the Shogun .
By becoming the Shogun as a favor to others he aimed to man@@ ip@@ ulate politics to his advantage .
Through the French Minister Le@@ on Ro@@ ches , he received 2.@@ 4 million doll@@ ars from France and founded Yoko@@ suka I@@ ron@@ works , a ship@@ yard , and a ship repair doc@@ k , and he also led a revol@@ ution in the military system by inv@@ iting a group of military advis@@ ors headed by J@@ ules B@@ run@@ et .
He also sent his biological younger brother , Akit@@ ake TOKUGAWA , to the Paris Ex@@ position and encouraged the younger members of the Shogunate vassals to study in Europe .
On the matter of opening of port of Hyogo , he ten@@ ac@@ iously persuaded the Imperial Court and obtained the Emperor 's permission .
Yoshinobu antic@@ ip@@ ated a secret order to S@@ ac@@ cho ( Satsuma and Choshu -@@ han Cl@@ ans ) from the Emperor to destroy the Shogunate , and on O@@ c@@ t . 14 , 1867 , he ( as a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure ) suggested to the Imperial Court that he would return his political power to the Emperor ; his request was accepted by the Emperor on the 15th , the following day ( Taisei Hokan ) .
It is said that he judged the Imperial Court at the time to have no cap@@ ability to ad@@ minister government , and he therefore sought continu@@ ation of Tokugawa Family 's political power by leading the S@@ ession of Clan Chi@@ efs .
However , because of the anti-@@ Shogunate activ@@ ists Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA 's scheme , there was a command to revive the political power of the Imperial Court in December , and Yoshinobu was ordered " Jik@@ an No@@ chi " ( to resign from his position as Naidaijin and surrender the Tokugawa territory ) .
In order to avoid confron@@ tations Yoshinobu retreated to Osaka-jo Castle , assembled the amb@@ assad@@ ors from various foreign countries and asserted the legitimacy of Tokugawa ; furthermore , he appealed to the Imperial Court and had the Jik@@ an No@@ chi modified to more mod@@ erate terms .
However , in response to the prov@@ ocation caused by Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan in the city of Edo in 1868 he mobilized his army and bloc@@ k@@ aded Kyoto using the armies of Aizu and Ku@@ wan@@ a-@@ han Cl@@ ans .
Nevertheless , at the Battle of Toba Fushimi that broke out on January 3 , even though the military force was holding up ad@@ equ@@ ately , he judged that the former Shogunate army was at a dis@@ advantage ; he abandoned his army and retreated to Edo-jo Castle ab@@ o@@ ard war@@ ship Kai@@ yo Maru .
Soon an order was issued to subjugate Yoshinobu as the enemy of the Imperial Court , and the Imperial Army led by General Prince Arisug@@ awa Taruhito set off to the east .
Yoshinobu suppressed the resistance party led by Tadamasa O@@ GU@@ RI and asserted to comp@@ ly with the order .
In February , he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take control of the situation and entered into a discipl@@ inary confinement at Dai@@ ji-@@ in located in Kan '@@ ei-ji Temple in Ueno .
Furthermore , he passed on the estate of Tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ Soke ( the main branch of Tokugawa Family ) to his adopted son Kam@@ en@@ osuke TA@@ YA@@ SU ( future I@@ esato TOKUGAWA ) .
The negotiation between K@@ atsu and the Staff Officer of the Imperial Army , Takamori SAIGO , reached an agreement and B@@ lo@@ od@@ less Sur@@ rend@@ er of Edo-jo Castle took place ; Yoshinobu was moved to Mito and he continued his discipl@@ inary confinement in a room within Kod@@ okan of [ Mito ] Han ( Domain ) School .
In July , [ the entire ] Tokugawa family was relocated to Sunpu .

In September of 1869 Yoshinobu 's discipl@@ inary confinement was lif@@ ted as a result of the end of Boshin War .
Thereafter he did not participate in politics and spent his days im@@ mer@@ sed in his interests such as phot@@ ography , hunting , n@@ et fishing , playing go and noh songs .
He moved to Sug@@ amo , Tokyo in 1897 .
In the following year he visited the Imperial Palace and had and audience with Emperor Meiji .
In 1902 he was bestowed a title of Ko@@ shaku and he established the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family aside from the main branch of Tokugawa Family .
He passed on the family estate to Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA and he retired in 1910 .

On April 30 , his contributions to Taisei Hokan were recognized and he was awarded Kun@@ -@@ it@@ to Ky@@ oku@@ jitsu Dai@@ ju@@ sho from the Meiji Government .
He retired on December 8 .
He died ( at 4 : 10 A.@@ M@@ . ) on November , 22 , 1913 .
On the same day , he was awarded Ky@@ oku@@ jitsu Toka Dai@@ ju@@ sho .
As far as education and studying of martial arts are concerned , he was born and raised under the very best circumst@@ ance ; among many forms of martial arts he was especially interested in and was an expert in shur@@ iken ( dir@@ k-@@ throwing ) .
Even after Taisei Hokan , he practiced throwing the shur@@ iken every day until he was swe@@ ating , and he is counted as one of the most famous persons among the shur@@ iken experts .
He t@@ os@@ sed about a lot in bed in his sleep , and his father , Nari@@ aki TOKUGAWA , thought that this would be a problem when he became the heir to the Tokugawa Family ; in order to correct this , r@@ az@@ or bl@@ ades were planted into his pill@@ ow ( this was done just to sc@@ are him , and in reality the r@@ az@@ or bl@@ ades were removed after he had fallen as@@ le@@ ep so as to prevent any inj@@ uries ) .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that in his adul@@ th@@ ood he sle@@ pt with his wife and a concubine so that the three of them formed the letter " Y " as a measure against assassination attempts .
There is supposed to be a photograp@@ h of Yoshinobu from his early childhood , but because cam@@ eras were probably not yet introduced to Japan at that time , it is doubtful that the photograp@@ h is that of Yoshinobu .
Yoshinobu visited Iemochi when he fell ill , and at this occasion it is said that they had a normal conversation .
His extraordinary talent was well known , and his father Nari@@ aki TOKUGAWA 's conf@@ id@@ ant , Tat@@ ew@@ aki A@@ JIMA , commented on him as " someone who will pur@@ ify the Tokugawa Family line " ; he sing@@ ly shou@@ ld@@ ered the exp@@ ec@@ tation of restoring the Shogunate 's authority , and when his highly tou@@ ted ten@@ ure as the Shogun began , his bril@@ liance was praised as " the return of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA " .
Yoshinobu 's intellig@@ ence was well known even among the An@@ ti@@ -@@ Shogunate Party , and Takayoshi KIDO of Cho@@ shu-@@ han Clan in particular was on guard saying , " Yoshinobu HI@@ T@@ OTSU@@ BASHI 's dar@@ ing and intellig@@ ent strategy cannot be under@@ estimated .
It is like seeing the return of Ieyasu . "
Regarding the decision on Taisei Hokan , Ryoma SAKAMOTO said , " My respected Shogun , I won@@ der what you are feeling in your heart today .
I praise how you made the [ difficult ] decision , I praise how you made the [ difficult ] decision .
I make a v@@ ow to dedic@@ ate my life to the Lord . " Ryoma highly praised Yoshinobu and he even considered giving Yoshinobu a position as Assistant Kanpaku in the New Government .
However , Yoshinobu did not learn about the existence of Ryoma until the Meiji era ( after Ryoma 's death ) .
Yoshinobu was not the only person who did not know about Ryoma ; Ryoma 's fame in his life time was very much smaller than that after the Meiji Restoration .
When he lost the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and retreated to Edo , his enemies highly criticized him for " running away in the face of the enemy " .
There were people who made fun of Yoshinobu for being a sp@@ in@@ eless c@@ ow@@ ard , poin@@ ting out that even though he left behind Ieyasu 's um@@ aj@@ ir@@ ushi ( sign belonging to the clan general / chief and used in a battle ) of golden fan , he always had his bel@@ oved concubine with him .
However , there is a view that Yoshinobu had no choice [ but to retreat ] because at that time it was necessary to suppress military revol@@ ts in Edo as well as in Musashi Province , and because Yoshinobu became the Imperial Court 's enemy , various clans were ali@@ en@@ ating themselves one after another from the Shogunate ; thus , even if he was able to protect Osaka-jo Castle , a long-@@ term battle had to be avoided in order to prevent inter@@ ven@@ tions from foreign countries .
Because he entered Kan '@@ ei-ji Temple for discipl@@ inary confinement as soon as the New Government designated him as the Imperial Court 's enemy , he was considered as a reasonable man who respected the Emperor and the Imperial Court ( per@@ haps this was due to the teaching of Mit@@ o-@@ han [ Clan ] that highly respected the Emperor and also to the fact that his mother was from the Imperial Family ) ; however , on the other hand , he was also called weak@@ -@@ k@@ need because as the lord of his people , he was not able to stand resol@@ utely in the face of the enemy .
Because of his comp@@ liance with the discipl@@ inary confinement and the B@@ lo@@ od@@ less Transf@@ er of Edo-jo Castle , the administrative power was transferred as a result of almost a blood@@ less revol@@ ution ; he contributed greatly to the Restoration and ens@@ uring of independ@@ ency of modern Japan .
Bus@@ in@@ ess@@ man Ei@@ ichi SHIBU@@ SAWA was a vassal appointed during [ Yoshinobu 's ] ten@@ ure as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family , and they kept their contact even after the Meiji Restoration .
In Yoshinobu 's last years , SHIBU@@ SAWA aimed to edi@@ t Yoshinobu 's biography ; he persuaded un@@ w@@ illing Yoshinobu and started " Sek@@ im@@ ukai " meetings to hear stories directly from Yoshinobu .
A collection of these stories is called " Sek@@ im@@ ukai Hik@@ ki " .
In one of the chapters which was recorded in the form of a discussion , one can see what Yoshinobu 's voice , so to speak , was like .
He used his age as an exc@@ use to ev@@ ade un@@ pal@@ at@@ able questions and he let out his true feelings by saying , " I didn 't really like Hisamitsu SHIMAZU " and " Naomasa NA@@ BE@@ SHIMA was a c@@ un@@ ning fellow " ; from these comments , one can see his personality and what he was feeling at that time .
After Yoshinobu 's death " Tokugawa Yoshin@@ o@@ bu-@@ ko D@@ en " was completed based on these materials .
In order to show his gratitude to Emperor Meiji who pardoned Yoshinobu from being the enemy of the Imperial Court and gave him the title of Ko@@ shaku , the highest rank of the pe@@ ers , Yoshinobu directed in his will that his funeral be conducted in the Shinto style rather than the Buddhist style .
Therefore , Yoshinobu 's grave is neither in the Tokugawa Family graveyard of his family temple Z@@ oj@@ o-ji Temple or the Tokugawa Family graveyard at Kan '@@ ei-ji Temple ; instead , a tumulus similar to that of the Imperial Family was built in Yan@@ aka C@@ emetery .
He did so because he was moved by the fact that Emperor Komei 's tomb was very simple ( " Tokugawa Yoshin@@ o@@ bu-@@ ko D@@ en " ) .
After his par@@ don , Yoshinobu enjoyed a rel@@ ax@@ ed life without any regards to his former vassals who devoted their lives to him ; on this , Roju Katsu@@ kiyo ITA@@ KURA later commented , " I reg@@ ret working together with Yoshinobu " .
Even though he has an image of being a sp@@ in@@ eless c@@ ow@@ ard , because he " ran away in the face of his enemy " during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , there has recently been a focus on his attempt at constructing a new , modern political system after Taisei Hokan , and there is a movement to re-@@ evalu@@ ate his contributions including air@@ ing of " TOKUGAWA Yoshinobu " ( an NHK Taiga Drama ) .
As with his father , Nari@@ aki , he liked pork from Satsum@@ a-@@ han Clan and he was called But@@ a@@ ichi-@@ sama ( meaning Hitotsub@@ ashi-@@ sama who lik@@ es pork ) .
He was interested in items of western culture , and in his later years he liked to eat bread and drink milk and he enjoyed his interests in phot@@ ography , fishing , riding the bicy@@ cle , mic@@ ros@@ copy and craft ( embroid@@ ery ) . During his ten@@ ure as the Shogun , he learned French from Aman@@ e NISHI but he gave up on this .
He was well know as a photograp@@ her , but his techniques in phot@@ ography seemed to have been medi@@ oc@@ re .
He often submitted his photograp@@ hs to phot@@ ography magazines , but his photograp@@ hs were hardly ever printed in the magazines .
His great grandchild , Yoshitomo TOKUGAWA , is a fre@@ el@@ ance photograp@@ her ; he discovered photograp@@ hs stored in the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family including the ones taken by Yoshinobu and he published the ph@@ oto al@@ bu@@ m after organizing and edit@@ ing them .
Yoshinobu 's biological younger brother , Akit@@ ake TOKUGAWA , was his friend who shared his hob@@ b@@ ies in his life .
He married Mik@@ ako ICHIJO ( name changed to Mik@@ ako after the Meiji Restoration ) on December 3 , 1855 .
The first daughter ( Kei@@ ko@@ in ) between Mik@@ a was born on July 16 , 1858 but she soon died on July 20 .
Afterwards , there were no more children between Mik@@ a ; the 10 boys and 11 girls born during the Meiji era were children born between his two concubines .
Some of these children include the seventh son , Yoshihisa , who became a Ko@@ shaku and succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family , tenth son , Kuw@@ ashi , who married into Kaishu KATSU 's family and ninth daughter , Tsune@@ ko , who became Prince Fushimi Hiro@@ yasu .
Some of Yoshihisa 's children include Yoshimitsu TOKUGAWA and Princess Kik@@ uko who married Prince Takamatsu Nobu@@ hito .

Notes
The JR Nara Line is a railway line ( art@@ erial line ) of the West Japan Railway Company ( JR West ) that runs between Kizu Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) in Kizugawa City , Kyoto Prefecture , and Kyoto Station in the Shimogyo Ward of Kyoto City , Kyoto Prefecture .
The entire rail line is included in the section covering the met@@ ropolitan area and its sub@@ urb@@ s .
Although the Nara Line officially starts at Kizu Station because it is historically a branch line of the Kansai Main Line , outbound trains ( od@@ d-@@ numbered trains ) run from Kyoto to Kizu and inbound trains ( ev@@ en-@@ numbered trains ) run in the opposite direction .
Un@@ less otherwise specified , the descriptions are given according to the outbound direction from Kyoto to Kizu , except for in the track data section .
The line 's own color is brown , which has been chosen to represent ' a classic , sophisticated impression suitable for connections between two historic cities . '
Administration ( type of business ) : West Japan Railway Company ( Railway Business Oper@@ ator )
Tr@@ ack length ( operating kilometers ) : 3@@ 4.@@ 7 km
Tr@@ ack gauge : 10@@ 67 mm
Number of stations : 19 ( including the stations at both ends of the track section )
D@@ ou@@ b@@ le-@@ track section : Shinden Station - Uji Station ; J@@ R@@ -@@ Fujin@@ omori Station - Kyoto Station
Elec@@ tri@@ fied section : The entire rail line is electrified ( D@@ C 15@@ 00@@ V ) .
B@@ lock ( railway ) : automatic block system ( double-@@ track section ) , single-@@ track automatic block system ( single-@@ track section )
S@@ af@@ ety equipment : A@@ T@@ S ( Aut@@ omatic Train Stop system )
Oper@@ ation direction center : Shin-@@ Osaka integrated direction center
Ma@@ ximum speed : 1@@ 10 km / h ( double-@@ track section ) , 9@@ 5 km / h ( single-@@ track section )
All stations except Kizu Station are managed by the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company , while the Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka branch of the West Japan Railway Company .
The line between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station is called the Nara Line , but the entire line lies within Kyoto Prefecture , not in Nara Prefecture .
This is because , initially , the Nara Line was built by Nara Railways between Kyoto Station and Nara Station , but Kizu Station and other stations south of Kizu Station were separated from the Nara Line in order to be part of a route between Osaka and Nagoya after Nara Railways was merged into Kansai Railways .
However , trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station in Nara Prefecture through the Kansai Main Line ( Yamatoji Line ) .
JR West established popular names ( JR Kyoto Line , JR Kobe Line or the like ) for the lines in the Ur@@ ban Net@@ work with the revision of March 13 , 1988 , but a popular name was not given to the Nara Line .
The Nara Line is also referred to as the ' JR Nara Line ' in order to distinguish it from the Kintetsu Nara Line of Kintetsu Corporation .
The Nara Line was referred to as the ' JNR Nara Line ' in the era of Japan National Railways ( JNR ) , the former JR , and the information board included the English notation ' JNR . '
The Kintetsu Nara Line compet@@ es with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara , whereas the JR Nara Line compet@@ es with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line .
While many trains used to run on the Keihan Uji Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line ( both of which run parallel to the Nara Line ) , the Nara Line was only electrified toward the end of JNR in 1984 ; consequently , it remained just a small local line on which the JNR / JR Com@@ mu@@ ter Train Series 10@@ 5 ( compris@@ ing two cars or the like ) ran for some time , even after electri@@ fication , until the privatization of the JNR .
However , after the foundation of JR West and the Nara Line 's incorpor@@ ation into the Ur@@ ban Net@@ work , the improvement of transportation services was quickly achieved with , for example , trains comprised of four cars ( some comprised of six cars ) , double-@@ tr@@ acked in part , or with increased numbers of trains , including rapid services such as the ' Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service . '
Today , the Nara Line is characterized by the access it offers to sightseeing areas such as Byod@@ o-in Temple in Uji City , or by a commuter line for passengers from the southern part of the Kyoto Prefecture , such as Joyo City .
However , trains go around toward the east between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station and run the edge of the central part of town in Joyo or to the south of Joyo ; thus the regional and transportation g@@ aps between the Nara Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line remain .
R@@ oll@@ ing stock owned by the Osaka branch for the Nara rail yard is used , but station facilities are maintained by the Kyoto branch ( except for Kizu Station ) .
The following commuter passes can be used at all stations on this line : J-@@ T@@ H@@ RU / ICOCA ; Su@@ ica , which is offered by the East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) ; TO@@ I@@ CA , which is offered by the Central Japan Railway Company ( JR Central ) ; and PiTaPa , which is offered by the Sur@@ ut@@ to Kansai Association .
S@@ imp@@ le ticket gates are used at Joyo Station or stations to the south of Joyo Station , as some un@@ manned stations still exist .
After the limited express ' Kuro@@ shi@@ o ' connecting Kyoto Station with Wakayama Station via the Nara , Sakurai and Wakayama lines ceased operation in 1984 , only the local trains ran until 1991 ( except for the temporary operation of a special limited express ) , but now there are four types of trains : the Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service , the rapid service , the trains classified by operation and section , and the local train .
The Miyak@@ oji Rapid Serv@@ ic@@ e-@@ -@@ the fast@@ est train on the Nara L@@ in@@ e-@@ -@@ runs mainly during the day .
The train basically runs every 30 minutes and vari@@ ously connects with the local trains at Uji Station .
The public gave this train the nickname ' Miyak@@ oji rapid train ' before it went into operation .
Not only Japanese people but also foreign visitors use the Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service as a train connecting Kyoto with Nara , both of which are sightseeing dest@@ inations .
The cars are all from the JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 , which compris@@ es either four or six cars .
The maximum train speed is 1@@ 10 km / h in double-@@ track sections , or 9@@ 5 km / h in other sections .
The standard travel times are approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto to Nara and about 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto .
A train bound for Kyoto stops at Kamik@@ oma Station or Tan@@ akura Station for about two minutes and passes the Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service bound for Nara , thus making a sl@@ ight difference between the travel times of the inbound train and outbound train .
During the New Year holiday the train temporarily stops at Inari Station for visitors to Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine .
History
March 3 , 2001 : Oper@@ ations began .
March 15 , 2003 : The train began making stops at Tofuku-ji Station and Tam@@ am@@ izu Station through a revision of the schedule .
The rapid service runs during the morning and evening rush periods .
It stops at J@@ R@@ -@@ Ogura Station and Shinden Station ( Kyoto Prefecture ) , through which the ' Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service ' passes .
The cars used are all from the JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 , which compris@@ es either four or six cars .
The train basically runs every 30 minutes and vari@@ ously connects with the local train at the Uji Station .
Like the Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service , the rapid service passes through Nar@@ ayama Station , at which the rapid train on the Yamatoji Line stops .
Before the ' Miyak@@ oji rapid train ' came into operation in March 2001 , the rapid train had stopped at Kyoto , Uji , Joyo ( except at the beginning ) , Kizu and Nara stations , employ@@ ing the JNR / JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 1@@ 17 for its cars ; since then , however , this series has not been used on the Nara Line .
Some rapid service trains run through to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and evening due to the schedule of operation .
The regional rapid service runs mainly in the morning and n@@ ight@@ time hours .
Initially , the operation was limited to weekdays , but with the schedule revision of March 18 , 2006 it was changed to Satur@@ days and holidays in addition to weekdays .
The regional rapid service stops at every station between Uji Station and Nara Station , while some regional rapid services bound for Kizu used to pass the local train at Uji Station in the late evening , etc . , due to the schedule ; however , based on the current schedule , the regional rapid service doesn 't pass the local train before reaching the arrival station .
All regional rapid services emp@@ lo@@ y the JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 , except that one regional rapid service leaving Kyoto Station between 8 p@@ .m. and 9 p@@ .m. on Satur@@ days and holidays employ@@ s the JNR / JR Com@@ mu@@ ter Train Series 103 .
Due to the operation schedule , some regional rapid services run through from the Yamatoji Line during the morning rush period .
The regional rapid service on the Nara Line formerly used orange letters as the Line 's own color , but it was the same color as the one used for the ' Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service ' and the rapid service so as to distinguish the regional rapid service on the Nara Line from that of the Yamatoji Line . However , in March 2008 , with the replacement of signs along with the revision of the schedule , a sign for the regional rapid service was changed to include green letters , whereby the use of the line color was stopped .
At the Kamik@@ oma Station or stations to the north of Kamik@@ oma Station , purple letters are used on the timetable boards .
The local train runs between Kyoto Station , Uji Station , Joyo Station and Nara Station .
The train runs every 15 minutes during the day between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station , and every 30 minutes between Joyo Station and Kizu Station .
Basically , the cars are from the JNR / JR Com@@ mu@@ ter Train Series 103 , but some are from the JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 .
Due to the schedule , some local trains go through to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late evening .
For@@ mer@@ ly , some local trains would go through to the Sakurai Line , but with the schedule revision of September 4 , 1994 , the Nara and Sakurai lines were divided .
For@@ mer@@ ly , a limited express ran on the Nara Line as a special train .
A limited express which had the nickname ' Kuro@@ shi@@ o XX ' from 1987 to 1988 and ' Kuro@@ shi@@ o XX ' from 1988 to 1989 , the JNR / JR Limited Express Series 3@@ 8@@ 1@@ ran between Kyoto Station and Shir@@ ahama Station via the Kansai Main Line , the Kansai Main Line Han@@ wa Freight Line and the Han@@ wa Line .
The Kinki edition of the Yom@@ iuri Shinbun newspaper announced on January 6 , 1998 that a limited express compris@@ ing the JNR / JR Limited Express Series 3@@ 81 would begin operating ( as a regular train ) on the Nara Line in about 2001 , but eventually the plan was canc@@ eled .
The Miyak@@ oji le@@ is@@ ure train ran between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station ( the Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service ran for the section between Kyoto Station and Nara Station ) for some time , but now there is no train excluding a special train going through to the Sakurai Line .
The Uji-gawa River fire@@ works display ( nearest stop : Uji Station ) is held in mid-@@ August , when the special schedule is introduced to secure sufficient transport capacity before 4 p@@ .m. to the end ; after 4 p@@ .m. , only the local trains run between Kyoto Station and Uji Station at intervals of approximately 10 minutes .
Kizu Station is the arrival and departure station of some local trains .
When the Nara Line was a single track , a special schedule was adopted during the New Year holidays , according to which the rapid train stopped at every station between Kyoto Station and Uji Station , and the number of trains traveling to Uji Station was increased .
During some New Year holidays the train would arrive at and depart from Momoyama Station .
In about 1992 ( mainly on Satur@@ days and holidays ) a through train to the Sakurai Line bound for Tenri Station ran once an hour by extending its regular rapid service .
O@@ cc@@ as@@ ionally , trains reserved for groups enter the Nara Line from around the country .
During the Ten@@ ri@@ kyo Autumn Grand Service held every October 26 , particularly , the through train den@@ oted as a ' train reserved for groups : Ten@@ ri@@ kyo transportation train ' runs from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station via the Nara Line , to Nara Station via the Yamatoji Line , and to Tenri Station via the Sakurai Line .
All cars belong to the Nara rail yard .
JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21
The Nara Line shar@@ es the JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 ( compris@@ ing two , four or six cars ) with the Yamatoji Line , the Osaka Loop Line , etc .
The JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 compris@@ ing either four or six cars is used mainly for the ' Miyak@@ oji Rapid Service ' and the ' Rapid Service , ' while the one compris@@ ing four cars mainly enters the Nara Line .
The JR Sub@@ urban Train Series 2@@ 21 ( compris@@ ing two cars joining two other cars ) runs according to the holiday schedule .
JNR / JR Com@@ mu@@ ter Train Series 103
The JNR / JR Com@@ mu@@ ter Train Series 103 ( compris@@ ing four cars ) is used on the Nara Line for the local train , while the one compris@@ ing eight cars ( four joining four other cars ) is used on the Osaka Loop Line and on the Yamatoji Line for the regional rapid service during the rush hours .
Part of the rolling stock is replaced with stock transferred from the Osaka Loop Line 's Mor@@ inomiya rail yard .
The line connecting Kyoto , Kizu and Nara was opened by the Nara Electric Railway , and initially trains ran the same route as the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line between Kyoto and Momoyama .
In 1921 , the Tokaido Main Line between B@@ aba ( currently Ze@@ ze ) Station and Kyoto Station was switched to the current line via the Higashiyama tunnel ; and on the same day the old Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Inari Station and a new line between Inari Station and Momoyama Station came to serve as the Nara Line , whereby the line between Kyoto Station and Fushimi Station was abolished and the line between Fushimi Station and Momoyama Station was made a freight line .
Later , the land after the line between the Kyoto Station and the Fushimi Station was sold to the Nara Electric Railway , a predecessor of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line .

The single-@@ track sections between J@@ R@@ -@@ Fujin@@ omori and Uji stations , and between Shinden and Kizu stations , remain under discussion , but no specific plan has been established .
Moreover , the acqu@@ isition of land along National Route 24 between J@@ R@@ -@@ Fujin@@ omori Station and Momoyama Station , and along the Keihan Uji Line between Koh@@ ata Station and Uji Station ( near Obaku Station ) is particularly difficult .
Due to a shortage of budget , no further plan will proce@@ ed before the double-@@ trac@@ king of the entire Sagano Line ( between the Sanin Main Line Kyoto Station and Sonobe Station ) is completed .
At the Council for Transportation in the Kinki region , a plan for operation of the Nara Line through to the Tokaido Main Line ( JR Kyoto Line ) in the future is under discussion ( there was once an overnight service from the late evening of December 31 to the early morning of January 1 ) .
Uji City is planning to build a new station between Obaku Station and Uji Station .
There is no inter@@ mediate station under direct control , except for Rokujizo Station and Uji Station ( JR West ) .

The Kei@@ ji By@@ pass is the by@@ pass of a national highway that extends from Kusatsu City in Shiga Prefecture to Kum@@ iyama Town , Kus@@ e-gun in Kyoto Prefecture .
It is a planning route designated as a local high-@@ standard highway .
The first description below refers to a t@@ oll road called the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass and the second refers to a by@@ pass joining National High@@ ways 1 and 24 that is also called the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass .
Its t@@ oll road section is integrated in the Meishin Expressway to connect the Rit@@ to Interchange ( in the direction of Nagoya City ) and the Su@@ ita Interchange ( in the direction of Osaka City ) of the Meishin Expressway by passing round the urban areas of Otsu City and Kyoto City .
In terms of laws , the section from the Set@@ a-@@ higashi Interchange to the Kum@@ iyam@@ a@@ yodo Interchange , being part of the national high@@ ways 1 and 4@@ 78 , is a regional high-@@ standard road ; the Kum@@ iyam@@ a@@ yodo Interchange to Oyamazaki Jun@@ c@@ tion , a part of National Highway 4@@ 78 , is a high-@@ standard highway designated by the Ministry of Land , In@@ frastructure and Transportation ( a national highway only for vehicles ) ( Kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ s@@ oto-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro B@@ elt Line of the Kyoto juk@@ an-@@ jid@@ ou@@ sh@@ do Expressway ) ; and the section from Oyamazaki Jun@@ c@@ tion to Kum@@ iyam@@ yodo Interchange is a national express highway ( a section called the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass of the Chuo Jid@@ o@@ sh@@ a-do National Expressway ) .
To reduce cong@@ estion on the Meishin Expressway and respond to the need for a road network that could serve as a rad@@ ial road and belt line in Kyoto City , the construction of the Kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ s@@ oto-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro B@@ elt Line was subsequently planned to connect the Kyoto-@@ Tanb@@ a-@@ d@@ oro ( formerly the by@@ pass of National Highway 9 ) to the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass .
The Kyoto Juk@@ an-@@ Jid@@ o@@ sh@@ ado Expressway and the Kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ s@@ oto-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro B@@ elt Line were designated as National Highway 4@@ 78 , and their construction has been continuously promoted .
On traffic signs , the section between the Set@@ a-@@ Higashi Jun@@ c@@ tion and the Oyamazaki Jun@@ c@@ tion is identified as the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass so as to make it easier for dri@@ vers to understand the signs .
Whi@@ ch@@ ever route is ch@@ os@@ en-@@ -@@ the Meishin Expressway or the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass@@ --@@ the same t@@ oll and E@@ T@@ C commuter dis@@ count service apply .

The Uji Tunnel of this section is , at 4,@@ 3@@ 13 meters , the longest on the National Highway ; l@@ ane changes are prohibited in the tunnel except between the area 500 meters short of the Kas@@ at@@ ori Interchange and the Uji@@ higashi Interchange .
A well-known Japanese movie called " Od@@ oru Dai@@ s@@ os@@ asen The MO@@ V@@ I@@ E 2 : B@@ lock up the R@@ ain@@ bow Bridge " was fil@@ med around the Kum@@ iyama Jun@@ c@@ tion before it was opened .
Because less distance is traveled between the Set@@ a-@@ higashi Jun@@ c@@ tion and the Oyamazaki Interchange / Jun@@ c@@ tion if dri@@ vers take the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass instead of the Meishin Highway , a driver driving at the speed limit on the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass will arrive at their destination more quickly than a driver driving at the speed limit on the Meishin Highway .
The Kei@@ ji By@@ pass has no rest service areas or other such facilities , so it 's less cong@@ ested than the Meishin Expressway ( which has two rest areas : Otsu R@@ est Area and Katsur@@ agawa R@@ est Area between Set@@ a@@ higashi and Oyamazaki . )
However , due to the design of both the Set@@ o-@@ hig@@ ashi@@ a and Oyamazaki j@@ unc@@ tions , which require ram@@ ps ( in the highway lan@@ es ) to connect them to the Meishin Highway ( in particular the very complicated design of the Oyamazaki j@@ unction ) , dri@@ vers have to reduce their speed .
Another dis@@ advantage is that dri@@ vers often en@@ counter cong@@ estion as they attempt to mer@@ ge into the left l@@ ane of the Meishin Highway from the Oyamazaki Jun@@ c@@ tion toward Su@@ ita or Osaka .
Moreover , many dri@@ vers dis@@ like the win@@ ding areas and sl@@ op@@ es along the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass , so the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass doesn 't fully perform its function as a by@@ pass .
Furthermore , it 's a by@@ pass of National Highway 1 ( a general national highway ) , which means it isn 't a expres@@ sway but a mot@@ or highway .
When dri@@ vers want to get on the Kei@@ ji By@@ pass toward Su@@ ita or Osaka from the east side of the Uji-gawa River ( near the Uji@@ higashi Interchange ) , they must go to the Ujin@@ ishi Interchange .
This is because the Uji@@ higashi Interchange is a half-@@ inter@@ change .
As a result , local roads lin@@ king the Uji@@ higashi and Ujin@@ ishi inter@@ changes are commonly cong@@ ested during the rush hours .
This area is outside the V@@ I@@ C@@ S ( V@@ e@@ hi@@ cle Information and Commun@@ ication System ) lin@@ k zone , which makes it difficult for dri@@ vers to use their cong@@ est@@ ion-@@ avo@@ id@@ ance sch@@ em@@ es .

Higashi Hongan-ji temple is a Shin Buddhist temple in Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto City , Kyoto .
It is the head temple of the Otani sect , which is part of the Shinshu Kyo@@ dan Reng@@ o ( Ten Schools of Shin Buddhism ) , and also jo@@ ins Nishi Hongan-ji temple ( officially Hongan-ji temple , head temple of the Hongan-ji sect of Shin Buddhism ) , as one of the main temples of Shin Buddhism .
The official name of the temple was " Hongan-ji " until 1987 , since which time it has been " Shinshu Hon@@ b@@ yo Temple " .
To distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji temple , also in Shimogyo Ward , it is often called " O-@@ Higashi-@@ san " .
( For history before the east-west split , refer to the article on The History of Hongan-ji Temple . )
Kyo@@ unyo ( K@@ ou@@ ju ) , the 12th master of Hongan-ji Temple , was given a domain for a temple to the east of Hongan-ji by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , and founded Higashi Hongan-ji Temple when Hongan-ji Temple split in 1602 .
Located in present day Karasuma Shichijo , Shimogyo Ward , Kyoto , it is called Higashi Temple ( Eastern ) Hongan-ji Temple because it is to the east of Nishi ( Western ) Hongan-ji Temple , which is located at Horikawa Shichijo .
It was a religious corporation over@@ seen by the Otani sect until 1987 , at which time Hongan-ji Temple was legally dissolved and absorbed by the sect .
After that , Higashi Hongan-ji Temple 's official name became " Shinshu Hon@@ b@@ yo Temple " ( " Hon@@ b@@ yo " means the original sanctuary where followers hear the teaching of the patriarch Shinran , the rest@@ ing place of Shinran ) .
It is also to distinguish it from the break@@ away Higashi Hongan-ji sect of Shin Buddhism and emphas@@ ize its propri@@ ety .

Having had 4 fires in the Edo period , so many that it acquired the nickname , " F@@ l@@ aming Hongan-ji Temple " , the current buildings , though many burned and were rebuilt in the Meiji period , maintain the style of the time in their construction and the paintings on the walls .
The Go@@ ei-@@ do , which houses the statue of Shinran Shonin , is among the largest wooden buildings in the world ( currently covered by sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for a major restoration ) .
The Go@@ ei-@@ do Gate is also one of the three famous gates of Kyoto .
Shinran 's " Kyo@@ gyo Shinsho " ( National Treasure ) ( Bando Ed@@ ition ) is in its possession .

Amaterasu om@@ ikami ( Tensho daijin ) is a hum@@ an@@ ized Shinto god in Japanese .
In " Engishiki ( List of Official Shrines ) , " " Amaterasu " of Amaterasu Omikami is cited as " Amat@@ eru " when worshipped as the god of nature .
Amaterasu Omikami is the god of the sun and one of the Oy@@ agami ( parent deities ) of the Imperial Family ( the Kos@@ oshin ( imperial ancestor ) ) .
In " Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) , " Amaterasu Omikami is referred to as 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 御@@ 神 whereas in " Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) " the god is cited as 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 神 .
Another name given to her is O@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi no kami .
In " Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , " Amaterasu Omikami is referred to under different names , whereas in " Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) " she is consist@@ ently cited as " 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 御@@ 神 . "
Amaterasu Omikami is considered to be female , but some say the god is male .
Because the name of Amaterasu Omikami was used in the political scene as shown in " Kot@@ ai jingu g@@ ishi@@ k@@ isho , " Sho@@ ei MI@@ SHIMA and Tsu@@ tom@@ u SAI@@ JO even arg@@ ue that Takam@@ imusubi was the Kos@@ oshin ( imperial ancestor ) ; , and that Hir@@ ume was dei@@ fied and became Amaterasu Omikami .
At Ise Jingu Shrine , Amaterasu Omikami is typ@@ ically referred to as Amaterasu sume Omikami , S@@ ume Omikami or Amater@@ as@@ im@@ asu S@@ ume Omikami , particularly when the name is ut@@ tered before the altar in ceremonies .
In academic documents she is now custom@@ arily sp@@ elled " ア@@ マ@@ テ@@ ラ@@ ス " in kat@@ akana .
Some say that in old days she was cited as 天@@ 照@@ 太@@ 神 .
How Amaterasu om@@ ikami is described in myths
According to " Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) , " Amaterasu Omikami was born from Izanagi as she rin@@ sed her left eye when saf@@ ely returning from Y@@ omi ( the world after death ) where Izanami lived , in order to remove the dir@@ t .
At this time , Tsukuyomi was born from her right eye and Susanoo from her nose , and the three together have come to be called Mi@@ h@@ ashira no u@@ z@@ uno miko ( three noble children ) .
Izanagi then instructed Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara .
Because Susanoo — who had been instructed to rule Un@@ abara ( the sea ) — kept cr@@ ying , saying he wanted to go to the land of the roots ( the land of Izanami ) , he was finally expelled by Izanagi .
Although Susan@@ ao ascended to Takamanohara to meet Amaterasu Omikami , his elder sister , on the way to the land of the roots , Amaterasu Omikami , who assumed her brother was coming to depri@@ ve her of Takamanohara , armed herself and waited for him .
After Susanoo made a pl@@ edge to prove that he had no such intention , five male gods were born from Amaterasu Omikami 's Mon@@ ozane ( the media from which gods are given birth ) and three female gods from that of Susanoo , and Susanoo declared victory .
The following are the five gods considered to be born from Amaterasu Omikami 's mon@@ ozane and are therefore her children :
Ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi
Ameno@@ ho@@ hi
Am@@ atsu@@ hik@@ one
Ik@@ utsu@@ hik@@ one
Kum@@ an@@ oku@@ subi
Susanoo , sw@@ ept up by the event , became wild and violent at Takamanohara , causing his sister to hide herself in Ama no iw@@ ato ( the cave of heaven ) .
This threw the entire world into dar@@ kn@@ ess , and various problems occurred .
Y@@ ao yor@@ ozu no k@@ ami-@@ like Chichibu no kami ( the god of wisdom ) , Amen@@ o yag@@ okor@@ o@@ omo@@ ikane no mikoto and Amen@@ o k@@ oy@@ ane no mik@@ oto-@@ eventually became successful in getting her out of Ama no iw@@ ato , but she drove him out of Takamanohara .
Amaterasu Omikami — who had decided that she would have one of her sons , Ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi , desc@@ end to Ashihara no nak@@ atsukuni — dispatched Am@@ atsu kami ( the god of heaven ) there .
By the time Ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi was ready to desc@@ end to Ashihara no nak@@ atsukuni , where peace and order had been established , Ninigi — the grandchild of Amaterasu Omikami — was born and ordered to go down there by Amaterasu Omikami .
Inter@@ pre@@ tations
Because some myths say that Amaterasu Omikami sought opinions from her elder Am@@ atsu Kami ( the god of heaven ) about her specific act@@ s-@@ whether they were good or no@@ t-@@ and even followed his instructions , some consider that Amaterasu Omikami was a dei@@ fied Emperor who ruled the country by conducting religious services .
Others have viewed her as a dei@@ fied miko ( female Shinto attendant ) .
Her alias name , " Hir@@ ume , " literally means " the woman of the sun , " as a miko , an attendant of the sun god .
According to a theory , a miko who had served the god of the sun came to be regarded as identical to the god himself ; this caused the god to be thought of as female , although the god of the sun is typ@@ ically male .
Other theories consider that Amaterasu Omikami is female because her myth was established during the era of Empress Jito , or because Himiko was her model .
The idea that the god of the sun ( Amaterasu Omikami ) and the god of the moon ( Tsukuyomi ) were born from the eyes of Izanagi shows a strong influence of Taoism , whose can@@ ons " Rei@@ ho go@@ bu@@ jo " ( completed by the sixth century ) and " Go@@ ho in@@ nen@@ kyo " ( written at the beginning of the seventh century ) respectively contain descriptions of " turning his eyes into the sun and the moon " and " turning his left eye into the sun and his right eye into the moon . "
Some say there is a par@@ all@@ el@@ ism between Shinto and Taoism in some of the terms used for Ise Jingu Shrine , which wor@@ ships Amaterasu Omikami — such as okami ( great god ) , Jingu , itsu@@ ki no miya , itsu@@ ki no yakata , mur@@ asaki no m@@ izo , ki@@ yog@@ inu , mit@@ eg@@ ura and usu@@ kin@@ u — and in the idea behind dividing its shrine into Kot@@ ai jingu and Toy@@ ou@@ ke dai@@ jingu .
In compar@@ ative mythology , the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami is nearly identical to that of P@@ angu , as recorded earlier ( some@@ where during the third or fourth century ) .
Because the story of turning the eyes into the sun and the moon is a common anal@@ ogy found across Asia , some consider that the myth was propag@@ ated as pe@@ op@@ les mig@@ rated around the region during pre@@ history .
Some scholars point out that in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , the div@@ inity of Amaterasu Omikami , was changed in three stages .
The following describes the historical events and their details that triggered the changes :
6@@ 45 : The Taika era reforms took place .
It was after these reforms that the Imperial Family began to worship Amaterasu Omikami .
Hi no kami ( the god of the sun ) or the sun itself .
A male god called " Amat@@ eru " was widely worshipped .
" Engishiki ( List of Official Shrines ) " lists the shrines that contained within their names the word " Amat@@ eru " — like the Amat@@ eru Jinja Shrine of Tsushima , the I@@ ib@@ on@@ i@@ amat@@ eru Jinja Shrine of Harima and the Amat@@ eru mit@@ ama no mikoto Jinja Shrine of Tanba .
In fact , Amat@@ eru ( as the name of the male god ) is the alias name of Amaterasu Omikami 's grandson Ameno@@ ho@@ akari , who is the first ancestor of the Owari , Tsum@@ ori and Kai@@ fu clans .
Additionally , Ameno@@ ho@@ akari 's younger brother was Ninigi , the great-@@ grandfather of Emperor Jim@@ mu .
672 : The Jin@@ sin War broke out .
" O@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi ( a woman who wor@@ ships the god of the sun ) " or " Tanab@@ at@@ atsume . "
Two interpre@@ tations exist : first , to consider that the god worshipped was O@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi ( a female god ) , and secon@@ dly , to think that the god honored was Amat@@ eru , the male god in the form of a snake .
69@@ 8 : K@@ odai Jingu was elected .
" Amater@@ as , " or the ancestor god of the Imperial Family
A female god .
U@@ sing Empress Jito as a model , Amaterasu Omikami was changed from the god of nature into a hum@@ an@@ ized god .
Since then , the " Amaterasu " portion of Amaterasu Omikami , if not meant to be the Kos@@ oshin ( the ancestor of the Imperial Family ) , has been pronounced " Amat@@ eru . "
For example , in " Sar@@ ashina Nikki ( Sar@@ ashina Diary ) , " written around 10@@ 60 , the Amaterasu Omikami was cited as " 天@@ 照@@ 御@@ 神 " and the portion of " 天@@ 照 " was pronounced " amat@@ eru , " while in " Sendai ku@@ ji@@ hongi , " " 天@@ 照@@ 孁 " is provided with the fur@@ ig@@ ana read@@ ings " ア@@ マ@@ テ@@ ル@@ ヒ@@ ル@@ メ@@ ノ@@ ム@@ チ " ( " amat@@ eru hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi " ) .
From 1880 to 1881 , a fierce debate took place over the Shinto doctrine concerning which gods should be enshrined in the temple of Shinto Jim@@ uk@@ yoku ( office ) in Hib@@ iya , Tokyo .
Shi@@ to Jim@@ uk@@ yoku , which had decided to enshrine in its temple four gods and Z@@ ok@@ as@@ an@@ shin ( the three gods of creation ) -@@ Amen@@ o min@@ ak@@ anushi no kami , Takam@@ imusubi no kami and Kam@@ imusubi no k@@ ami-@@ and Amaterasu Omikami met with opposition from the Izumo group , which st@@ ressed the idea of Yuk@@ en ichin@@ yo ( the unity of this world and the world after death ) and insisted on worshi@@ pping five gods , including Ok@@ uni n@@ ushi no okami , the ruling god of Yuk@@ ai ( the world after death ) .
However , the Ise group , which had played the central role in Shi@@ to Jim@@ uk@@ yoku , argued that Amaterasu Omikami was the Great God of Heaven and Ear@@ th , which ruled Ken@@ rei ( this world and the world after death ) and that other gods were simply her subordinates , thus creating a full-scale confrontation between the two .
This confrontation es@@ cal@@ ated to the point where various rum@@ ors circulated that the Izumo group might be trying to settle a deep-@@ seated grudge against the Ise group , which had accumulated since the era of gods , and that Takat@@ omi SEN@@ GE , who had been dis@@ loyal to the Imperial Family , had to be killed as punishment .
This debate was eventually brought to an end by the decision of Emperor Meiji , resulting in the defeat of the Izumo group , and Amaterasu Omikami was ranked at the highest level of all the gods .
The government is said to have learned from this debate that it was impossible to establish a common Shinto doctrine and to rule the people of the modern state directly through its restoration .
For more information , see " D@@ eb@@ ate Regarding the Gods to B@@ e Enshrined , " by Shinto Jim@@ uk@@ yoku , Kok@@ ka Shinto ( State Shinto ) .
In depicting Amaterasu Omikami in his novel , Ry@@ unosuke A@@ KU@@ TAGAWA used the alias " O@@ hir@@ um@@ em@@ uchi . "
This is because he wanted to depict Amaterasu Omikami as the god of the sun or nature , not the Kos@@ oshin ( imperial ancestor ) associated with the name " Amaterasu Omikami . "
In fact , A@@ KU@@ TAGAWA had to make many revis@@ ions , add@@ itions and del@@ e@@ tions to his novels due to the inspection conducted by the army .
Masahiro YASU@@ OKA ( 189@@ 8-@@ 1983 ) , the founder of Kin@@ kei G@@ akuin ( 1926 ) , said that the Japanese people worshipped Amaterasu Omikami .
Amaterasu om@@ ikami represents the ideal of the Japanese spirit to cover the world with the r@@ ays of the sun .
The " Iz@@ ana " of " Izanami " and " Izanagi , " which means " to lead , " also represents an ideal of the Japanese people who set an example for other pe@@ op@@ les in the world as leaders , for@@ er@@ un@@ ners and origin@@ ators .
Shrines that honor Amaterasu om@@ ikami
Shrines that worship Amaterasu Omikami are called Shin@@ mei shrines and are scattered across the country , but their chief shrine is the Nai@@ ku ( inner shrine ) of Ise Jingu Shrine .
Kot@@ ai jingu is a shrine that houses Yat@@ aka no kagami ( Mirror of Yat@@ aka ) , one of the San@@ shu no jing@@ i ( three kinds of treasures ) , as the object of worship .
N@@ early all the shrines in Japan distribu@@ te the Shins@@ atsu ( tal@@ is@@ man ) ( Jingu tai@@ ma ( shrine am@@ ul@@ et ) ) of Kot@@ ai Jingu Shrine ( Ten@@ s@@ yo kotai jingu Shrine ) .
Daimyo is an expression that came from Dai@@ myo@@ shu .
It sign@@ ifies a person whose name is very famous .
As opposed to a Shom@@ yo .
It originally meant a person who wi@@ elds influence in a region .
Later , in samurai society , it came to mean a warrior who has a lot of territory or subordinates .
In the Muromachi period the Shugo strengthened their control over their assigned territories and became Shugo Daimyo .
In the Warring States period , Tai@@ shin Ryo@@ shu ( noble land owners ) appeared who established even stronger control over their territories , and were called Dai@@ myo@@ bun no Kokujin or Sengoku Daimyo .
In the Edo period the word specified a lord who was granted a territory of 10,000 koku or more from the Edo Shogunate .
Among warriors with less than 10,000 koku , those who belonged to the Shogunate were called Jik@@ isan .
In fact , because the feudal lords that were the Daimyo shared characteristics with Chinese lords ( sh@@ oko ) , they were also called Daimyo Shoko .
This section describes the details of the Edo period , recent Daimyo .
For Shugo Daimyo or Sengoku Daimyo , refer to the relevant articles .
Edo Period Daimyo
The rank of Edo period Daimyo was determined by family status , official rank , size of stipend , office , and service .
First , depending on his connection to the Tokugawa Shogun family , related families ( Shin@@ pan , Shin@@ pan Daimyo ) were classified mainly as F@@ udai Daimyo ( hereditary Daimyo ) that were vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara , and To@@ zama Daimyo ( non-@@ hereditary Daimyo ) that became vassals around the time of the Battle of Sekigahara .
The first Shogun , Ieyasu , in order to maintain the blood@@ line in the event that the Shogun household died out , for supervision and control of the Daimyo nationwide , and for support of the Shogunate , established three branch households of the Tokugawa family that were allowed to use the Tokugawa name , and sent the ninth son , Yoshinao TOKUGAWA , to the Owari domain , the 10th son Yorinobu TOKUGAWA to the Kishu domain , and the 11th son Yor@@ ifusa TOKUGAWA to the Mito domain .
B@@ eg@@ inning with the elder brother of the second Shogun , Hidetada TOKUGAWA , and second son of Ieyasu , Hideyasu YUKI , was sent to the Echizen domain , he placed Tokugawa family members as Daimyo all of the country .
Moreover , over the generations the hereditary vassals that supported the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogun family were placed as F@@ udai Daimyo , who secured the Shogunate 's military power while serving as important officials from the Shogunate 's chief minister to members of the council of elders , supported the Shogunate 's government .
The F@@ udai Daimyo had relatively small stip@@ ends , and aside from the prominent F@@ udai Hit@@ to in the Ii clan who received an unusual 3@@ 50,000 koku in the Hikone domain , the Torii , Sak@@ ak@@ ib@@ ara , Hon@@ da and Ogasawara clans received relatively large stip@@ ends , but throughout the Edo period only a few F@@ udai Daimyo maintained more than 100@@ .@@ 000 koku , starting with the Sakai , Abe , Hot@@ ta , Yanag@@ isawa , and T@@ oda clans .
This was for the separation of influence and military power .
The To@@ zama Daimyo were the Daimyo that joined after the Battle of Sekigahara , and many had opposed the Tokugawa at Sekigahara .
The Shogunate was very careful about that , actively carried out intellig@@ ence gathering activities using sp@@ ies , and when they feared impro@@ pri@@ ety or insur@@ rec@@ tion , did not hes@@ it@@ ate to rev@@ oke rank .
Representative of the To@@ zama Daimyo were the Kaga Domain of the Maeda clan , famous for the million koku of Kaga , the Satsuma Domain of the Shimazu clan , a family famous from the Kamakura period , the Sendai Domain of the Date clan , the Fukuoka Domain of the Kuroda clan , the Hiroshima Domain of the Asano clan , the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan , the Yonezawa Domain of the Uesugi clan , the Saga Domain of the Nab@@ es@@ hima clan , the Kumamoto Domain of the Hosokawa clan , the Okayama and Tottori Domains of the Ikeda clan , the Tokushima Domain of the Hachi@@ suka clan , the Tosa Domain of the Tosa Yam@@ auchi clan , and the Akita Domain of the Satake clan .
The status of a Daimyo was defined as Koku@@ shu if their territory was one province or more , or an equivalent number of koku , as Jo@@ shu Daimyo ( joshu class ) if they had a castle , those without a castle were distinguished as Jin@@ ya , and the rooms that they occupied at Edo castle during their service there were differenti@@ ated based on the Daimyo 's status .
Refer to Shik@@ oseki for details .
A@@ side from Daimyo in charge of provinces , those with 100,000 koku were generally not allowed possession of a whole district , and usually held territory around the castle and in pat@@ ches .
In extreme cases , rule of a single village was divided between two land holders ( ai@@ kyu ) .
Daimyo , as a rule , had 10,000 koku or more , but the Kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa clan 's Kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa domain was 5,000 koku .
That was because the Kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa clan were descendants of the Ashikaga clan .
Daimyo were subject to control by the Shogunate through the L@@ aws for the Military Hous@@ es and the san@@ kin kotai ( alternate attendance ) system .
Other than that , there was a system of assign@@ ments called ot@@ etsu@@ dai , and at the end of the Edo period some were ordered to defend the coast , so the Daimyo were always in a difficult position fin@@ anci@@ ally .

The Muromachi period dictionary " Setsu@@ yoshu " listed the two pronunci@@ ations ' tai@@ mei ' and ' daimyo , ' the former meaning a Shugo ( a major feudal lord ) , and the latter meaning a wealthy person ( the wealthy class ) .
In the Warring States period , the distinction by pronunciation weakened , and it is thought that ' tai@@ mei ' was common .
The Ni@@ pp@@ o Jisho ( Japanese-@@ Portuguese dictionary ) from the beginning of the 17th century also listed the two pronunci@@ ations , ' daimyo ' and ' tai@@ mei , ' but there was no clear distinction in meaning , and both were used for major feudal lords .
The pronunciation settled on ' Daimyo ' after the beginning of the Edo period , and by the Kansei era they were solely called ' Daimyo . '
