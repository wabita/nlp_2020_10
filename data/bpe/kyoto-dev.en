Rinzai Zen Buddhism is one of the Chinese five Hous@@ es / seven Schools of Zen ( Rinzai , I@@ g@@ you , Soto , Un@@ mon , Hog@@ an ) and G@@ igen RI@@ N@@ ZAI ( ? - 8@@ 67 ) of Tang was its founder .
He was known as " RI@@ N@@ ZAI of Kat@@ u ( meaning to help wake up the sle@@ eping mind ) " and " General RI@@ N@@ ZAI " , and rose to the top of Chinese Zen with his distinctive style .
With its Zen Tal@@ ks that try to awak@@ en self awar@@ eness through study of Koan , it differs from the Sil@@ ent Zen of the Soto sect , which just does meditation .
Rinzai School in China
As the name implies , Rinzai School started with its founder G@@ igen RI@@ N@@ ZAI at the end of the Tang dynasty , after the anti-@@ Buddhist movement at the Kai@@ sho@@ u era .
RI@@ N@@ ZAI was the disciple of Ki@@ un O@@ BA@@ KU ; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of He@@ bei , with the support of Chang@@ shi WA@@ NG of the Han@@ chin government , but in the confusion that arose around the end of the Tang dynasty , He@@ bei was at the center of the t@@ umul@@ tu@@ ous five dynasties and it became difficult to su@@ st@@ ain a religious movement .
The central figure around that time was En@@ sho@@ u FU@@ KE@@ TSU .
It was in the Northern Song dynasty that Rinzai School became vi@@ bran@@ t again , below the gates of Sek@@ iso SO@@ EN , along with En@@ an O@@ U@@ R@@ YU and Hou@@ e YO@@ U@@ GI who came from Ji@@ ang@@ x@@ i province and created the two main sec@@ tes of Rinzai ( O@@ ur@@ yu and Y@@ oug@@ i ) , and sw@@ ept across all of China .
When it came to the Southern Song dynasty , Sou@@ ko@@ u DAI@@ E , a disciple of Kokug@@ on E@@ N@@ GO who belonged to the Y@@ oug@@ i sect , started the Dai@@ kan sect in Z@@ he@@ ji@@ ang province , which became a major sect in the Rinzai School .
Rinzai School in Japan
According to doctrine , it was brought over to China from India by Bod@@ hid@@ harma , the 2@@ 8th successor of the 10 disciples ( called Ka@@ sho ) who directly received the teaching ( enlightenment ) of S@@ idd@@ har@@ th@@ a G@@ aut@@ ama .
Later the Rinzai school , which achieved the p@@ inn@@ acle of Zen teaching , was brought to Japan in the Kamakura period by E@@ isai , who went to China to study in the Southern Song period .
Japan 's Rinzai is one of Zen schools in Japan .
It emphas@@ izes the transmission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple . ( Has@@ su is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master . )
It calls Sak@@ yamuni the Original Teac@@ her V@@ en@@ erable Sak@@ yamuni Buddha , Bod@@ hid@@ harma the First An@@ c@@ est@@ or and Great Teac@@ her Bod@@ hid@@ harma , and RI@@ N@@ ZAI the Foun@@ der and Great Teac@@ her Rinzai .
In contrast to the Soto Zen school which sp@@ reads through regional clans and the general people , the Rinzai School received support from Samurai families in government , and was est@@ e@@ emed in the politics and culture .
Later , the Rinzai School was rebuilt in the Edo period by Master HA@@ KU@@ IN , and continued to be called H@@ akuin Zen .
Trad@@ itions
Trans@@ mission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day ( Has@@ su is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master ) .
The important inter@@ action between the master and disciple is called " a secret in the room " and is not to be taken out of the master 's room and revealed publicly .
What is ex@@ tracted from the inter@@ actions between a master and disciple , or Zen lecture trans@@ crip@@ ts that record the actions of a master , is called a Koan ( precedent ) and various collections have been compiled since the Song dynasty ; but enlightenment is not something that can be communic@@ ated with words , so when people today try to understand the text , the Koan itself ref@@ uses them .
However , they contain hin@@ ts that lead people toward enlightenment , and there are a great many Zen books from the beginning down to the present day .
Also since the Song dynasty , the Zen schools changed to a Kann@@ az@@ en style in which masters give lectures using trans@@ crip@@ ts of Zen talks and the masters became not to display the same maj@@ esty as those in the Tang dynasty including Rinzai .
Although masters choose their successors when they die , the successors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time , but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself .
Even if the new master had not attained enlightenment , the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment , therefore it is possible to take such a measure .
It is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters , or at his discre@@ tion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end .
Many lines have split , and some have disappeared ; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day .
En@@ lighten@@ ment
The Zen sects generally emphas@@ ize enlightenment over knowledge .
En@@ lighten@@ ment in Zen means that all living things realize the inher@@ ent bud@@ d@@ ha nature they pos@@ s@@ ess .
For this reason , masters in the Tang dynasty strugg@@ led to enlightenment through much hard@@ ship .
However , they began to dev@@ ise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the Song dynasty .
These were systemat@@ ized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as Z@@ az@@ en ( not the same as meditation ) , Koan ( understanding stories that sur@@ pass intellect@@ ual understanding ) , Dok@@ you ( reading sutras ) , or Sam@@ u ( everyday work ) under an already enlighten@@ ed Zen master .
En@@ lighten@@ ment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a cand@@ le fl@@ ame passes to a cand@@ le that is un@@ lit ( called D@@ ent@@ ou ) .
That is not a transmission based on words ( log@@ os ) .
For this reason , it is considered cruc@@ ial to choose the right Zen master .
That means not just cho@@ os@@ ing one who has gained enlightenment , but one who f@@ its with one 's own personality .
Act@@ ually , it does not mean that an enlighten@@ ed Zen master instruc@@ ts and en@@ ables someone gain enlightenment .
M@@ asters in the Tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from any@@ body - not to mention S@@ idd@@ har@@ th@@ a G@@ aut@@ ama ( Buddha , Shak@@ us@@ on ) , who gained enlightenment without a teacher .
While it is impossible to def@@ ine enlightenment with words , words are one of many methods that can describe the boun@@ d@@ aries of enlightenment .
That is why , especially after it was brought to Japan , enlightenment has been expressed through artistic expression such as poetry and painting , so that one can get a taste of its ar@@ oma .
Other than in art , it is also expressed in de@@ por@@ tments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement ; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born .
That is not an intellect@@ ual understanding .
The Koan System
The Koan system came together after the Song dynasty , and though they might be fab@@ ric@@ ated it has made even more enlighten@@ ments possible .
Most Koan are made up of conver@@ s@@ ations between a master and disciple , telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment .
Koan cannot be received with log@@ ical , intellect@@ ual understanding , and are stories beyond log@@ ic that can be understood only by completely becoming the Koan itself instead of thinking .
The Koan system was established by collecting these Koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 Koan stories .
Koan system differs according to the master 's style .
Examples of Koan stories in the beginning .
" Do@@ es a dog have bud@@ d@@ ha@@ -@@ nature ? " " It does not have . "
As the background , any Buddhist kn@@ ows that " all living things have Buddha@@ -@@ nature . "
The S@@ ound of One H@@ and Cl@@ apping
A disciple has to listen to the sound of cl@@ apping with one hand and show that to the master .
By intellect@@ ual understanding , it is impossible to cl@@ ap with one hand and make a sound .

Fushimi-jo Castle was a castle in what is now Fushimi Ward , Kyoto City .
" Fushimi Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle " is a recent construction that did not exist historically ( details to follow ) .
Fushimi-jo Castle was originally built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI for his own residence after retirement .
Construction sp@@ an@@ ning the reigns of 3 emperors , it was first built on Mt . Shiz@@ uki , there called Shiz@@ uki Fushimi-jo Castle , and after an earthquake was moved to Mt . Koh@@ ata and named Koh@@ ata Fushimi-jo Castle .
Furthermore , there was the Koh@@ ata Fushimi-jo Castle that was built in the days of Toyotomi , and the one that was rebuilt in the Tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of Sekigahara .
After Hideyoshi 's death and in accordance with his will , Hideyori TOYOTOMI moved to Osaka-jo Castle ; after which Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , leader of the council of 5 elders , moved into this castle and took over government .
Although it was protected by Ieyasu 's vassals , Mototada TORII et alia , during the Battle of Sekigahara , it was attacked and burned by Ishi@@ da ( the Siege of Fushimi-jo Castle ) .
It was later rebuilt by Ieyasu ; and after it was r@@ azed its structures and materials were moved to other locations .
After it was r@@ azed , the location of the cit@@ ad@@ el was made into a pe@@ ach or@@ ch@@ ard and was called Momoyama ( P@@ each Mountain ) .
That is why Fushimi-jo Castle is typ@@ ically called Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle ; and this is the reason why the period of Od@@ a-@@ Toyotomi government is called the " Azuchi-Momoyama Period " and the culture of the time called " Momoyama Culture " .
According to the account that says the descendants of the family that re@@ claimed the land are the Yoshimura family , which founded Yoshimura Shu@@ zo , they were the heads of Hor@@ iuchi Village , built on the ruins of Fushimi-jo Castle ; and it is said that they transferred village land to the Imperial Household in the Meiji Period .
Histor@@ ically , there was no direct connection .
Since the Tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ era keep was moved to Nijo-jo Castle , there is a relatively large number of artifacts left ; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep .
The details are unclear .
1592 - In the low-@@ lying hi@@ lls along the Uji-gawa River where Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI made his home on Mt . Shiz@@ uki in retirement , parts of the disman@@ tled Jur@@ ak@@ udai were transferred for the building of a castle ( Shi@@ zuk@@ i-jo Castle ) .
1596 - Because it was destroyed in an earthquake , a new castle was built about 500 meters away on Mt . Koh@@ ata ( present day Mt . Momoyama ) .
1598 - Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI died in this castle
1600 - Bur@@ ned in the Siege of Fushimi Castle
1601 - Re@@ built by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA
1603 - W@@ as the site of the inauguration of Seii Taishogun
Fushimi-jo Castle 's functions moved to Osaka-jo Castle after the Siege of Osaka , reduc@@ ing this castle 's importance in the eyes of the Edo Shogunate ; and it was therefore r@@ azed in 16@@ 25 after Ieyasu TOKUGAWA 's retirement .
1964 - Fushimi Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle Land , an am@@ usement park featuring a m@@ ock castle keep " Fushimi Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle " , was built on the site of the Fushimi-jo Castle flower garden .
January 2003 - Fushimi Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle Land was closed as part of the re@@ struc@@ turing of its parent company , Kintetsu Corporation .
Fushimi Momoy@@ ama-jo Castle escaped destruction thanks to a movement by the people of Kyoto to preserve it as a symbol of Fushimi .
Nowadays it is maintained as a park .
The City of Kyoto received it at no cost ; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deteriorated with age .
October 2007 - When it was rem@@ od@@ eled to look like Osaka-jo Castle for the fil@@ ming of a period movie , " Ch@@ ac@@ ha : The Wom@@ an from F@@ ar A@@ way " , the ti@@ ger decorations below the watch tower and Sh@@ achi@@ hoko were painted gold .
With Toei Fil@@ ms bearing the rem@@ od@@ eling cost of around 1 million yen , work to rem@@ ake it into Osaka-jo Castle continues within the year .
When the castle was disman@@ tled , the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations .
The most famous are Nijo-jo Castle and J@@ oj@@ ak@@ ko-ji Temple ; the tur@@ rets , castle gate , palace , bath , Tam@@ on Yag@@ ura Tur@@ ret , and earthen walls all were moved to Fuku@@ yama-jo Castle ( Bingo Province ) .
Bel@@ ow is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist .
Note : Among these , the only ones that can be prov@@ en are the guest hall of Sai@@ kyo@@ -ji Temple , which is the remains from Mt . Shiz@@ uki , and Fuku@@ yama-jo Castle 's Fushimi Yag@@ ura , which is left over from the Tokugawa era .

The Kan@@ o@@ ha group is the largest ga@@ ha ( group of painters ) in Japanese art history , and was active for about 400 years from the middle of the Muromachi period ( fifteenth century ) to the end of the Edo period ( ninet@@ eenth century ) as a group of expert painters that consist@@ ently dominated the art world .
Masanobu KANO , the official painter of the Muromachi shogunate , was the earliest ancestor ; his descendants worked for Nobunaga ODA , Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and the Tokugawa Shogun as painters after the collapse of the Muromachi shogunate , consist@@ ently domin@@ ating the art world associated with the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , thus greatly influ@@ encing Japanese art circles as a professional painter group working on works ranging from screen paintings in the Imperial Palace , castles or large temples to small paintings such as those created on fans .
The Kan@@ o@@ ha group is a painter group mainly concerned with cons@@ angu@@ inity such as parents or brothers ; it reigned over the nation 's realm of art for as long as four centuries , a period un@@ equ@@ aled any@@ where in the world .
Pro@@ min@@ ent painters of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group include the founder Masanobu KANO , who worked for Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the Muromachi shogunate ; his heir , Moton@@ obu KANO , a grandson of Moton@@ obu ; E@@ itoku KANO , who created screen paintings of the Azuchi and Osaka castles ; a grandson of E@@ itoku , Tan@@ yu KANO , who moved from Kyoto to Edo and supervised the creation of screen paintings of Edo Castle and Nijo Castle ; San@@ raku KANO , who stayed in Kyoto , thus representing a group called ' Kyo Kano . '
Once the structure of the Edo shogunate had become stable , the members of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group were driven to get extensive orders done for screen paintings of the Imperial Palace and castles as the shogunate 's official painters .
In order to ful@@ fill large numbers of orders for screen paintings , the head of the Kano family needed to lead the painters so they could work in a group .
Consequently , the painters of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group needed to learn ancestral painting examples and ways of painting without expressing their individ@@ uality as painters .
Given such an historical back@@ drop , it can be said that the Kan@@ o@@ ha group after Tan@@ yu KANO only tried to keep the tradition and maintain influence as official painters , and therefore lost its artistic drive .
In the present day , an artist 's expression of individ@@ uality and ment@@ ality is valued , so the evaluation of paintings of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group is not necessarily high .
However , it is a fact that the Kan@@ o@@ ha group led the Japanese art world for about four centuries and that numbers of painters were developed by the group ; thus one can hardly discuss the history of Japanese painting but ex@@ clude the Kan@@ o@@ ha group , whether in positive or negative terms .
It is also a fact that many Japanese painters after the early years of the modern age were influenced by the Kan@@ o@@ ha group and started with the influence of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group ; initially , Korin OGATA , of the Rin@@ pa group , and Ok@@ yo MARU@@ YAMA of the Sh@@ as@@ ei@@ ha group had learned from the Kan@@ o@@ ha group .
The Kan@@ o@@ ha group was founded by Masanobu KANO ( c . 14@@ 34 - 15@@ 30 ) , who worked as the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate .
He lived quite long for a Japanese of the time ( it is commonly believed that he died at age 9@@ 7 ) , and worked from the middle of the fifteenth century until the early sixteenth century .
It is said that he was from the Izu area , but that is uncertain .
Due to the progress of study after the late twenti@@ eth century , it is spec@@ ulated that the Kano family was some@@ how related to the Nagao clan in Ashikaga , Shimotsuke Province ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) ; and " Wat@@ er@@ fall , " an ink painting that remains at Ch@@ or@@ in-ji Temple in Ashikaga City , is considered a relatively early work by Masanobu .
The first painting work recorded as having been done by Masanobu is the screen paintings he did of the Deity of Mercy and Lu@@ o@@ han in Un@@ cho@@ in , Shokoku-ji Temple Tower , which he did in Kyoto at the age of 30 in 14@@ 63 . This was just before the turmoil of the Onin War ( 1467 - 14@@ 77 ) ( as reported in In@@ ryok@@ en Nichi@@ roku ( In@@ ryok@@ en 's Diary ) ) , which tells us that Masanobu was already working as a painter in Kyoto by that time .
Shokoku-ji Temple , as the main temple building of Un@@ cho@@ in , where Masanobu created the screen paintings , is a Z@@ end@@ era temple constructed by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA , the third Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate ; it is the heart of the Muromachi art world , which produced arti@@ st-@@ monks such as Jos@@ etsu , Shu@@ bun , Ses@@ shu ; moreover , in those days Sotan ( Sotan O@@ GU@@ RI , 14@@ 13 - 14@@ 81 ) , an arti@@ st-@@ monk who was a disciple of Shu@@ bun , worked as an official painter .
Although it is not exactly certain when Masanobu KANO went to Kyoto , whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , it is clear ( according to certain records ) that Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , the eighth Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate , gave him an important position .
In 14@@ 81 , a few years after the t@@ umul@@ tu@@ ous Onin War ( 1467 - 14@@ 77 ) , which had lasted for a dec@@ ade , Sotan , the official painter for the Muromachi shogunate , died ; thus it is thought that Masanobu KANO was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate , succeeding Sotan .
Subsequently , Mitsun@@ obu TO@@ SA , of the Yamat@@ oe group ( a style of Japanese painting ) who was in the post@@ ion of Ed@@ okor@@ o-@@ azuk@@ ari ( a leader of painters who worked for the Imperial Court ) of the Imperial Court , and Masanobu KANO of the Kang@@ a ( a Chinese style of painting ) group , became two major forces in the art world .
In 14@@ 82 , the former Shogun , Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA , started the construction of Higashiyama dono ( the predecessor of Gin@@ k@@ aku-ji Temple ) , and Masanobu took charge of the screen paintings .
Following the death of Yoshimasa in 14@@ 90 , Masanobu worked for the Hosokawa clan , which had political power at the time .
In this way Masanobu solid@@ ified his position in the art world while deep@@ ening his relationship with the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group .
According to records , it is known that Masanobu created works in various styles and subjects , including screen paintings and Buddhist paintings ; however , all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll .
His painting style was ' k@@ anga , ' with ink painting based on the bru@@ sh@@ work of Sung and Yuan in China , in contrast to the traditional Yamat@@ oe of his contemporary , Mitsun@@ obu TO@@ SA .
Although Masanobu lived until age 9@@ 7 , it isn 't clear what work he produced during the last 30 years , and it seems he had his heir Moton@@ obu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement .
The second generation , Moton@@ obu KANO ( 14@@ 76 - 15@@ 59 ) , who built the basis of prosperity of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group , was the heir of Masanobu .
His best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of Dai@@ sen@@ in , Daitoku-ji Temple ( the hojo , or chief priest 's room , was completed in 15@@ 13 ) and another one in Rei@@ unin , Myoshin-ji Temple in 15@@ 43 ( it is widely believed that the screen paintings in Dai@@ sen@@ in were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period ) .
The creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of Dai@@ sen@@ in was divided among So@@ ami , Moton@@ obu and his brother Yuk@@ inobu KANO , depending on the room ; accordingly , Moton@@ obu took charge of " Four Se@@ as@@ ons , Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds " in ' D@@ ann@@ a no M@@ a ' and " Foun@@ der of the Zenshu sect " in ' I@@ h@@ atsu no M@@ a . '
" Foun@@ der of Zenshu sect " is a typical ink painting , while " Four Se@@ as@@ ons , Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds " is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time , as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds .
Moton@@ obu strengthened the ties with the Ashikaga Shogun and the Hosokawa clan as the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , had numerous disciples and consolidated the basis of the Kan@@ o@@ ha as a group of painters .
He accepted orders from court nobles , temples and shrines as well as samurai families ; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple in Osaka according to the historical record , but this no longer exists .
Because Moton@@ obu referred to himself as ' Echizen no kami ' in his later life , he was given a priest@@ ly rank called ' Hogen ' however , for post@@ erity he has been referred to as ' Koh@@ ogen ' or ' Echizen Hogen . '
The work is wid@@ e-@@ ranging : he created the Engi Emaki of temples and shrines , vo@@ tive pictures , g@@ il@@ ded folding screens in the Yamat@@ oe style , and portraits as well as screen paintings .
Moton@@ obu assumed the Yamat@@ oe painting style in Kang@@ a and ink painting ( in which his father Masanobu specialized ) ; he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a Fu@@ suma ( Japanese sliding door ) and a folding screen , and built a foundation for the style of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group .
He is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as Shin@@ tai ( standard style ) , G@@ yot@@ ai ( semi-@@ cur@@ sive style ) , and Sot@@ ai ( cur@@ sive style ) .
Moton@@ obu had three sons : Mun@@ enobu , Hideyori and Na@@ on@@ obu ; Na@@ on@@ obu ( 15@@ 19 - 1592 ) ; the first , Mun@@ enobu , died young , and the third son Na@@ on@@ obu succeeded as the head of family .
It is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son Na@@ on@@ obu instead of Hideyori , the second son .
Na@@ on@@ obu is widely known as Sho@@ ei KANO ( his posthumous name ) , and he was active from the Muromachi period to the Momoyama period .
The huge " Nirvana " ( six meters long ) in Daitoku-ji Temple is his fin@@ est work .
Although he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with his father Moton@@ obu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the Juk@@ oin , Daitoku-ji Temple with his son E@@ itoku , he was a less famous artist because his father Moton@@ obu and his son E@@ itoku were more prominent .
E@@ itoku KANO ( 15@@ 43 - 1590 ) , the heir of Sho@@ ei , is also called Kun@@ inobu ; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the Japanese art world from the Momoyama period .
Although he created numbers of screen paintings in strict comp@@ liance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild tim@@ es@@ --@@ including Nobunaga ODA and Hideyoshi TOY@@ OTO@@ MI@@ --@@ these paintings were lost with the buildings , so relatively few of E@@ itoku 's works remain in existence .
The paintings on the part@@ itions in the hojo of Juk@@ oin , Daitoku-ji Temple ( which are among his best existing works ) were created by E@@ itoku together with his father Sho@@ ei ; however , Sho@@ ei had E@@ itoku take charge of Fu@@ sum@@ ae of the major room in the south front of the hojo , while he took a supporting role .
In the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create Fu@@ sum@@ ae in the major room , so it is historically believed that , at the time such paintings were created , Sho@@ ei had already retired after transferring the family estate to E@@ itoku , who was a great talent .
" Flow@@ ers and Bir@@ ds " in Shit@@ chu ( the center front room of Hojo ) is very highly ac@@ claimed among the screen paintings of Hojo of Juk@@ oin .
Subsequently , E@@ itoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle Tower , which Nobunaga ODA constructed during the period from 157@@ 6 to 1579 .
He created screen paintings in the Osaka Castle of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Jur@@ ak@@ udai after Nobunaga died , and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the Imperial Palace .
These works were highly ac@@ claimed for their origin@@ ality in the jour@@ n@@ als and records of the time , so they would be E@@ itoku 's best works if they existed ; however , these paintings were lost with the buildings .
As E@@ itoku 's existing best works , the screen paintings in the hojo of Juk@@ oin , as previously described , are renowned as well as " F@@ oo dogs , folding screen " as former imperial property , and " Ur@@ ban and sub@@ ur@@ b of Kyoto , folding screen , " as handed down through the Uesugi clan ; it has also been said that " C@@ y@@ press , folding screen " in the Tokyo National Museum was painted by E@@ itoku .
E@@ itoku excelled at elabor@@ ate paintings and mon@@ umental paintings , although he had no choice but to paint in the mon@@ umental painting style in order to fill a large number of orders for screen paintings .
An elabor@@ ate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail , and mon@@ umental painting is interpreted as having a high-@@ min@@ ded style .
The Kan@@ o@@ ha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages .
" View@@ ing M@@ aple Leaves in Takao , " a designated national treasure , has the seal of ' Hideyori ' ; it has been said that this was painted by Hideyori KANO ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the second son of Moton@@ obu KANO ; however , it is also said that this ' Hideyori ' of " View@@ ing M@@ aple Leaves in Takao " is another painter called Hideyori SHI@@ N@@ SHO , a grandson of Moton@@ obu .
So@@ shu KANO ( 15@@ 51 - 1601 ) was a brother of E@@ itoku , also called Moto@@ hide , and worked as an assistant to E@@ itoku in the creation of the screen paintings in Azuchi Castle .
Fol@@ ding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him .
Nag@@ anobu KANO ( 157@@ 7 - 16@@ 54 ) , another brother of E@@ itoku , is renowned as the painter of " Pl@@ aying Under the Flow@@ ering Tre@@ es , " a national treasure .
As painters other than the direct line of the Kano family , Yoshinobu KANO ( 15@@ 52 - 16@@ 40 ) , who painted " C@@ raf@@ t@@ speople , folding screen " in Kawagoe Kit@@ ain , and Nai@@ zen KANO ( 1570 - 1616 ) , who painted " Hok@@ oku Festival , folding screen " in Kyoto Toyok@@ uni-jinja Shrine ( Kyoto City ) , are well known .
E@@ itoku KANO died at age 48 , preceding his father Sho@@ ei ( Na@@ on@@ obu ) .
E@@ itoku 's first son Mitsun@@ obu KANO ( c . 1565 - 160@@ 8 ) and second son Takanobu KANO ( 1571 - 16@@ 18 ) succeeded him .
Mitsun@@ obu created the screen paintings in the Rec@@ eption Hall of Kang@@ akuin , Onjo-ji Temple ; in contrast to E@@ itoku he specialized in delicate painting in the Yamat@@ oe style .
Such a style of painting might not have su@@ ited the public taste at the time , and the early modern ess@@ ays on paintings , including " Hon@@ ch@@ og@@ ashi , " generally put a low value on Mitsun@@ obu .
After the death of the Kano ｆ@@ am@@ ily head Mitsun@@ obu , his brother Takanobu led the Kan@@ o@@ ha group because his son Sadanobu KANO ( 159@@ 7 - 16@@ 23 ) was only 12 years of age .
Under the feudal system , the family line of Sadanobu , Mitsun@@ obu 's first son , was supposed to be the head of family ; however , Sadanobu died without an heir at the age of just 27 , so after that the legitimacy of the Kano family was the descendant of Takanobu till the end of the Edo period .
Takanobu had three son@@ s--@@ Mor@@ inobu ( Tan@@ yu 1602 - 16@@ 74 ) , Na@@ on@@ obu KANO ( 160@@ 7 - 16@@ 50 ) and Yasun@@ obu KANO ( 16@@ 13 - 168@@ 5 ) --@@ and they respectively became the earliest ancestor of the Kaj@@ ib@@ ashi Kano family , Kob@@ ik@@ icho Kano family and Nak@@ abashi Kano family .
Although the youngest son , Yasun@@ obu , succeeded as the Kano head of family as an adopted son of Sadanobu ( mentioned above ) , the most renowned painter was Mor@@ inobu ( also known as Tan@@ yu ) .
Mor@@ inobu later became a priest and called himself Tan@@ y@@ usai ; as a painter he is known as Tan@@ yu KANO .
He eventually moved to Edo and solid@@ ified the position of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group in the art world more as the official painter of the Edo shogunate .
Tan@@ yu exercised his painting talent from childhood ; in 16@@ 12 , he met Ieyasu TOKU@@ NAGA in Sunpu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in Edo Kaj@@ ib@@ ashi Mong@@ ai in 16@@ 21 , subsequent to which he worked based in Edo and ener@@ get@@ ically created screen paintings in castles and large temples .
Among Tan@@ yu 's works , the screen paintings in the Edo and Osaka castles were lost with the buildings , but the screen paintings ( ink paintings ) in Jor@@ ak@@ uden of Nagoya Castle are existent , having avoided an air raid during World War II because they had been removed from the building and evacu@@ ated ; additionally , the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle and the hojo of Daitoku-ji Temple are among his best existent works .
He created various kinds of works , including hanging ro@@ lls , picture scrolls and folding screens , as well as these large paintings .
He created the screen paintings in Ninomaru Palace of Nijo Castle when he was young ( 25 years of age ) , and they showed dy@@ nam@@ ism in E@@ itoku 's style ; however , the screen paintings in Daitoku-ji Temple , which he created later in his life ( mainly with ink and water ) , display a calm approach with abund@@ ant use of bl@@ ank space .
He had works in the Yamat@@ oe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well .
Tan@@ yu emphasized sket@@ ches and the copying of ancient paintings ; consequently , he left numerous sket@@ ch books and re@@ production books .
Many of Tan@@ yu 's copies of ancient paintings ( called ' Tan@@ yu R@@ educ@@ tion ' ) are existent , which are now part of mus@@ eums and collections around the nation , and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose origin@@ als are now lost , so they are valuable as data for the study of Japanese art history .
The Kan@@ o@@ ha group during the Edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a cons@@ angu@@ inity group mainly with the head family of the Kano family and numerous disciples around the nation , thus compris@@ ing a hierarchy .
They are clearly ranked : under the most prest@@ ig@@ ious four families ( called ' inner court painters ' ) there are about 15 families less prest@@ ig@@ ious called ' outer court painters ' and then the ' M@@ achi Kano painters ' who cat@@ ered to the demands of townspeople instead of the Imperial Court or temples and shrines ; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation .
The powers of the time sought the st@@ ability and continu@@ ity of feudal society , and the paintings for public places such as Edo Castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples ; they were not intended to be unique .
In order to create numbers of screen paintings , one must work in a group with all the disciples ; therefore , in order to make group work easier , the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one 's individ@@ uality as a painter .
In this respect it is und@@ en@@ i@@ able that the paintings of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group lack individ@@ uality and origin@@ ality .
It is said that the inner court painters ranked with Hatamoto and were allowed ' audience ' with the Shogun as well as bel@@ ting on a sword , which implies a high status .
The four families of the inner court painters are the Kaj@@ ib@@ ashi family , with lineage of Tan@@ yu ( the first son of Takanobu KANO ) ; the Kob@@ ik@@ icho family ( called Tak@@ ek@@ awa-cho family at the time ) , with lineage of Na@@ on@@ obu ( the second son of Takanobu ) ; the Nak@@ abashi family with lineage of Yasun@@ obu ( the third son of Takanobu ) ; and the Ham@@ acho family , with lineage of Min@@ enobu KANO ( 16@@ 62 - 170@@ 8 ) ( Min@@ enobu is the second son of Tsun@@ enobu KANO , the first son of Na@@ on@@ obu KANO ) .
Because Tan@@ yu had no child , he adopted T@@ oun ( Mas@@ un@@ obu KANO 16@@ 25 - 169@@ 4 ) , the son of Ryu@@ jo GOTO , a swordsm@@ ith .
Later , Morimasa KANO ( 16@@ 53 - 17@@ 18 ) who was his biological son ( born after Tan@@ yu turned 50 ) succeeded him , but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .
Among the numerous disciples of Tan@@ yu , Mor@@ ik@@ age KUSU@@ MI ( birth and death dates unknown ) , the cre@@ ator of " En@@ joy@@ ing the C@@ ool of the Ev@@ ening Under the Mo@@ on@@ flower T@@ rel@@ l@@ is , " is renowned .
Mor@@ ik@@ age was for some reason expelled from the Kan@@ o@@ ha group ; he worked in the Kanazawa area later , but his records aren 't completely clear .
As stated previously , the head family of Kano was succeeded by the Nak@@ abashi Family of Yasun@@ obu , a brother of Tan@@ yu .
Tok@@ inobu KANO ( 16@@ 42 - 16@@ 78 ) , a son of Yasun@@ obu , died in his thir@@ ties , and his son Ujin@@ obu KANO ( 16@@ 75 - 17@@ 24 ) succeeded the family estate ; however , subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .
It@@ cho HANA@@ BU@@ SA ( 16@@ 52 - 17@@ 24 ) , who was popular based on his sophisticated painting style , was a disciple of Yasun@@ obu .
The family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the Edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the Kob@@ ik@@ icho family , of Na@@ on@@ obu 's lineage .
This family line produced Tsun@@ enobu KANO ( 16@@ 36 - 17@@ 13 ) , the heir of Na@@ on@@ obu , and Tsun@@ enobu 's sons , Chikan@@ obu KANO ( 16@@ 60 - 17@@ 28 ) and Min@@ enobu KANO ( 16@@ 62 - 170@@ 8 ) .
Min@@ enobu won the favor of the Shogun Ienobu TOKUGAWA , and he later gained independence as ' Ham@@ acho family , ' which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families .
Besides them , Koi KANO ( date of birth unknown - 16@@ 36 ) was not related by blood to the Kano family but , along with his brothers , was a master of Tan@@ yu ; he was allowed to use the surname of Kano due to his achievements , and he worked for the Kishu Tokugawa family .
Meanwhile , a group called ' Kyo Kano ' remained active in Kyoto , and San@@ raku KANO ( 15@@ 59 - 16@@ 35 ) , a disciple of E@@ itoku KANO , was the pillar of the group .
San@@ raku was from the Kim@@ ura clan in Omi , the vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI ; his original name was Mitsu@@ yori KIMURA .
His best works are " Pe@@ on@@ ies " and " Red and White Pl@@ um Tre@@ es " in the main house of Kyoto Daikaku-ji Temple , and they have color@@ ful and decorative pictures on a golden base .
San@@ setsu KANO ( 158@@ 9 / 90 - 16@@ 51 ) , the husband of San@@ raku 's daughter , created the screen paintings in Ten@@ kyu@@ in , Myoshin-ji Temple as well as some paintings of folding screens , which are still in existence .
He had a distinctive painting style unique among painters of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group , such as distinct shapes of trees and rocks , as well as the complet@@ eness of detail .
The essay on paintings made by San@@ setsu and edited by his son E@@ ino KANO ( 16@@ 31 - 169@@ 7 ) is entitled " Hon@@ ch@@ og@@ ashi , " the first full-@@ f@@ led@@ ge painting history book by a Japanese .
The Kob@@ ik@@ icho family produced Mich@@ inobu KANO ( Mich@@ inobu E@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN ( 17@@ 30 - 17@@ 90 ) ) , Kor@@ enobu KANO ( Kor@@ enobu YO@@ SE@@ NIN ( 17@@ 53 - 180@@ 8 ) ) , Nag@@ anobu KANO ( Nag@@ anobu I@@ SE@@ NIN ( 17@@ 75 - 18@@ 28 ) ) and Os@@ anobu KANO ( Os@@ anobu SE@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN ( 178@@ 6 - 184@@ 6 ) ) during the late Edo period .
Os@@ anobu SE@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN led the creation of numerous screen paintings as a master of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group during the reconstruction of the Nishin@@ omaru and Honmaru pal@@ aces of Edo Castle , which had burned down in 18@@ 38 and again in 184@@ 4 .
Although the paintings are no longer in existence , numerous designs are in the possession of the Tokyo National Museum .
SE@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN also ende@@ av@@ ored to copy and collect ancient paintings .
Although the painters of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group in the late Edo period are not well appreciated generally , there is a move to re@@ ap@@ praise SE@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN as the progress of the study after the late twenti@@ eth century recogn@@ izes that he was a painter with good technique who e@@ ag@@ erly studied art from ancient paintings and on to the new painting movement at the end of the Edo period .
Hog@@ ai KANO ( born in Shimonoseki , 18@@ 28 - 1888 ) , a leading figure of the Japanese art world during the early Meiji period , like G@@ aho HASHIMOTO ( born in Kawagoe , 18@@ 35 - 1908 ) , was a disciple of Tadanobu KANO ( Tadanobu SHO@@ SEN '@@ IN 18@@ 23 - 1880 ) , the next generation of SE@@ I@@ SE@@ NIN .
Both Hog@@ ai and G@@ aho were from painter families of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group .
The historical role of the Kan@@ o@@ ha group as a professional painter group finished as its patron , the Edo shogunate , ended .
Personal information of Emperor SHIRA@@ KAWA
Emperor SHIRA@@ KAWA ( 7th July 10@@ 53 - 24th July 112@@ 9 ) was the 7@@ 2nd Emperor .
SHIRA@@ KAWA came to power on the 18th January 10@@ 73 and reigned until 5th anuary 10@@ 87 .
His posthumous name was Sada@@ hito .
SHIRA@@ KAWA was the first son of Emperor Go-@@ Sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the Fujiwara Five Regent Hous@@ es , and his mother , Nyogo , FUJIWARA no M@@ oshi / Shigeko was from Fujiwara Kan@@ in@@ ryu , the daughter of Chunagon FUJIWARA no Kin@@ n@@ ari , and the adopted daughter of Togu Daibu FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu .
His half sister was Princess Tok@@ ushi / Atsu@@ ko ( Empress of Horikawa )
Genealog@@ y
When he was young , he and his father were sn@@ ub@@ bed due to their background , but after his father was enthroned in 10@@ 68 ( J@@ ir@@ yaku 4 ) , he was proclaimed a Shinno ( Imperial prince ) and became Imperial Prince Sada@@ hito .
In 10@@ 69 he became Crown Prince , and became an Emperor three years later , when he was twenty years old .
A Kanpaku was assigned , but SHIRA@@ KAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done , after his father , the retired Emperor , died of illness in 10@@ 70 ( J@@ ir@@ yaku 5 ) , and also attempted to regul@@ ate the Shoen ( manor ) system thereby trying to weak@@ en the influence of the Regent / Kanpaku Hous@@ es .
Go-@@ Sanjo-@@ in and Go-@@ Sanjo-@@ in 's mother , Yom@@ ei@@ mon@@ -in , wished for SHIRA@@ KAWA 's younger half brother , Prince Sane@@ hito ( Heian period ) and then Sane@@ hito 's younger brother Prince Suke@@ hito to succeed to the throne , and upon abdication to SHIRA@@ KAWA , Prince Sane@@ hito was decided to become Crown Prince .
SHIRA@@ KA@@ RA rep@@ elled against this and later Prince Sane@@ hiro died from illness in 10@@ 85 ( Ot@@ oku 2 ) .
As a result , in November , 10@@ 86 ( Ot@@ oku 3 ) , SHIRA@@ KAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son , Prince Taruhito ( 7@@ 3rd Emperor Horikawa ) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Suke@@ hito and SHIRA@@ KAWA abdicated immediately .
Retired Emperor SHIRA@@ KAWA , who became Daijo Tenno , acted as the guardian of the young Emperor , and ruled personally as Shirak@@ awa-@@ in , and this style of government became known as Insei system ( cloistered style ) .
Through such system , although the Sessho and Kam@@ paku offices continued , they did not have actual power to rule the government .
SHIRA@@ KAWA continued to have ex@@ ert power even after Emperor Horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his des@@ po@@ tic position by appointing ai@@ ds from the Jur@@ y@@ ro and Samurai class .
The Samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the " Hok@@ umen no bushi " which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor .
SHIRA@@ KAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yuk@@ an after the death of his daughter in 109@@ 6 ( Ka@@ ho 3 ) .
SHIRA@@ KAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the Hos@@ sho-ji Temple , and he took advantage of getting finance from J@@ uryo .
After Emperor Horikawa died , SHIRA@@ KAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors , until he died on 24th July 112@@ 9 ( 7th July Tai@@ ji 4 ) , and he supported both his grandson 7@@ 4th Emperor Toba and his great grandson 7@@ 5th Emperor Sutoku .
This is called " Chiten no kimi " .
The Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa had supreme power , but it was said he ment@@ ed that , he has no control over the following three things : 1 . Wat@@ ers of the Kamo River ( tribut@@ ary of the Yodo River ) ( due to its flow and frequent fl@@ ood@@ ing ) ; 2 . D@@ ice used in sug@@ oroku ( different from current sug@@ oroku , close to western back@@ gam@@ mon ) , which was popular way of gam@@ bling at that time , with spots on the d@@ ice sel@@ ecting win@@ ners / los@@ ers ; and 3 . Yam@@ ab@@ oshi ( monk soldiers from Mt . Hi@@ e Enryaku-ji Temple ) , which show that SHIRA@@ KAWA had absolute control apart from these three things .
SHIRA@@ KAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that Emperor Sutoku and TAIRA no Kiyomori may be SHIRA@@ KAWA 's illegitimate sons , was widely spread and believed at the time .

The Kujo Family is one of the Sekke and a court noble .
The pro@@ gen@@ itor of this family was Kanezane KUJO , the third son of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi , a direct descendant of the Fujiw@@ ara-@@ hok@@ ke ( the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan ) .
The family name comes from the fact that the Kujo Family lived in Ku@@ jo-@@ den , which was located in Kyoto Kujo and said to have been built by FUJIWARA no Mototsune .
This individual was a d@@ uke after the Meiji Restoration .
The crest is Ku@@ jo-@@ Fuji C@@ rest .
A descendant of FUJIWARA no Kan@@ efusa ( grand minister of state ) , the younger brother@@ -@@ ut@@ er@@ ine of Kanezane , he is sometimes included in the Kujo family but Kan@@ efusa 's family line failed at an early stage .
The children of Michiie KUJO , a grandchild of Kane@@ zan@@ e-@@ -@@ Norizane KUJO , Yoshizane KUJO and Sanet@@ sune KU@@ JO@@ --@@ became regents to the emperor and started the Kujo Family , Nijo Family and Ichijo Family , respectively , thus con@@ stit@@ uting Gos@@ ek@@ ke .
Kanezane KUJO inherited the fief of the elder sister by a different mother , Kok@@ am@@ onin , which became the foundation of the Kujo Family fi@@ ef@@ dom .
Kanezane was critical of the Taira clan administration and P@@ ope Goshirakawa ; he became regent by recommendation of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo and then chief advisor to the Emperor , whereupon the Konoe and Kujo families took positions as regents to the emperor .
Kanezane 's grandson , Michiie KUJO , gained power in the Imperial court since Michiie 's son Yoritsune KUJO , and then Yoritsune 's son Yorit@@ sugu KUJO , became Sekke Shogun in the Kamakura Shogunate .
Kanezane 's diary , " Gyokuyo ( Kanezane KUJO 's Diary ) , " is famous .
The Kujo family 's fi@@ ef@@ dom continued to expand during medieval times . They held the l@@ ord@@ ship of Kar@@ oku , an area of land that yi@@ elded 2,000 koku of rice in the Edo era and 3,000 koku later on , until the Meiji era .
Setsu@@ ko , the fourth daughter of the d@@ uke Michitaka KUJO , who was Hisat@@ ada KUJO 's fir@@ st@@ born , became empress to the Emperor Taisho ( Empress Teimei ) .
Con@@ fl@@ ict over legitimate blood between the Kujo and Ichijo families
Michiie KUJO lost the legitimate heir , Norizane KUJO , and the second son , Yoshizane KUJO , was practically rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated .
Michiie gave Tad@@ aie KUJO , Norizane 's son and Michiie 's grandchild , to be the legitimate heir , a sh@@ obun@@ jo ( a kind of will ) to give instructions that documents such as diaries ( which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time ) should be inherited by the Ichijo Family , but that the head of a family who contro@@ ls the family temples such as Tofuku-ji Temple should first be inherited by Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO , the third son of Michiie , then by Tad@@ aie KUJO , a child of the eldest son of Michiie , and later by either descendant of the Kujo Family or the Ichijo Family who took the high@@ est-@@ ranking official position ( head of a clan ) .
In accordance with Michiie 's will , Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO 's descendant inherited the position as head of the family after Michiie died .
Thereafter , the pre@@ domin@@ ance of the Ichijo Family was maintained for over 100 years , whereby the position of the Ichijo Family as legitimate blood of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu ( Kujo family line ) was well established .
When Tsun@@ emichi ICHIJO died in 13@@ 65 ( the Hoku@@ cho period ) , during the Muromachi era , Tsun@@ enori KU@@ JO@@ --@@ who had gained the second position of power after the Ichijo Fam@@ il@@ y-@@ -@@ made an appeal to the Emperor Gok@@ og@@ on that Fus@@ at@@ sune ICHIJO , a son of Tsun@@ emichi , had fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ently identified himself as the head of family .
At that time , pri@@ m@@ og@@ en@@ iture was becoming the common practice , and Tsun@@ enori claimed that according to pri@@ m@@ og@@ en@@ iture the Kujo Family , the descendant of the eldest son of Michiie , should inherit the family estate .
Fus@@ at@@ sune ICHIJO argued against Tsun@@ enori , stating that just because an ancestor of the Kujo Family was the fir@@ st@@ born child it did not mean the Kujo Family was the legitimate blood of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu , and that because Michiie KUJO gave the family estate to Sanet@@ sune ICHIJO , the Tok@@ ad@@ o-@@ bunko ( Gon@@ n@@ jo-@@ mor@@ om@@ ichi-@@ ki ) ( Gon@@ i@@ jo-@@ mor@@ omichi record ) , Gyokuyo ( Kanezane KUJO 's diary ) and Gyoku@@ zui ( Michiie KUJO 's diary ) ) and the document end@@ or@@ sing the political authority of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu Sekkan-ke , a regent family , were inherited by the ICHIJO Family ; whereas Tsun@@ enori KUJO asserted that measures to give inheritance to Sanet@@ sune were taken just because Tad@@ aie KUJO was in inf@@ ancy , and that if Norizane KUJO had lived longer it would not have happened .
Tun@@ enori further asserted that Tad@@ aie KUJO was named as the rece@@ iver of the sh@@ obun@@ jo ( exec@@ ut@@ or of the will ) and the land pat@@ ent of the premise of Tofuku-ji Temple had been inherited by the Kujo Family because the Kujo was the legitimate blood .
Considering the political position of the Kujo Family at that time , the emperor gave Rin@@ ji to the Kujo Family on November 29 ( lunar calendar ) , in the same year giving the ver@@ d@@ ict that the will of Michiie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the Kujo and Ichijo families , both having the qual@@ ification , were on equal fo@@ oting as legitimate blood .
The Ichijo Family was the legitimate blood of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu during the Kamakura era , but after the middle Muromachi period the position of the Kujo Family was elevated and the Ichijo and Kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu .
The Kujo Family started inher@@ iting the Matsu@@ dono Family 's fi@@ ef@@ dom after the Middle Edo period ; thus the Kujo possessed the largest Kok@@ udaka , lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of Ku@@ jo-@@ ryu .

Old Ku@@ jo-@@ tei was in the southwest area of the present-day Kyoto Gyo@@ en .
Today only the garden remains , on the basis of maintenance .
Itsuk@@ ushim@@ a-jinja Shrine , which was then called Chinju-@@ sha , still exists on the island of the garden pond ( KU@@ J@@ O-@@ ike ) , and a simple but elegant t@@ ear@@ oom called Sh@@ usu@@ i-@@ tei is found near the pond .
The major buildings ( such as the main building ) were transferred to Ku@@ jo-@@ tei in Tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early Meiji era , and were recently donated by the Kujo Family to the Tokyo National Museum , which was named Ku@@ jo-@@ kan .
Yamashiro no Kuni , located in Kinai , was one of the administrative province ( Ry@@ osei@@ koku ) .
It was situated in the southern part of present day Kyoto .
It was also called Jo@@ shu ( un@@ usually it is also alled San@@ shu ) or Yo@@ shu .
In the Engishiki , it is ranked as Kok@@ ushi-@@ kuni tok@@ yu ( a Kokushi ( official ) governing province ) .
" Yamashiro " was written as 山@@ 代 in ancient times , and in the 7th century , the province ( kuni ) was founded with the name written as 山@@ 背@@ 国 .
On November 8 , 79@@ 4 ( Enry@@ aku 13 ) , when the capital was named Heian-kyo ( Heian Palace ) , the Emperor Kam@@ mu changed the second letter of the province 's name to 山@@ 城@@ 国
Based on the writings of " mok@@ kan " － strips of wood used for writing during the Heijo-kyo ( Heijo Palace ) period , the not@@ ations of Yamashiro no Kuni as 山@@ 代@@ 国 and 山@@ 背@@ 国 seem to have co@@ existed with 山@@ 城@@ 国 .
According to W@@ am@@ yo Ru@@ i@@ ju@@ sho , the provincial government office ( Kokufu ) was situated at the Kaya Imperial Villa ( Kaya Det@@ ached Palace ) .
On the other hand , it is recorded as " Otok@@ un@@ i-gun ( Ot@@ okuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) " in Shug@@ aisho .
In the col@@ op@@ hon and afterward titled " Ke@@ ich@@ o-@@ two En@@ ir@@ in@@ shi " of Setsu@@ yoshu ( pro@@ of@@ ed by Ek@@ irin ) it is also recorded as " Otok@@ un@@ i-gun ( Ot@@ okuni District ) , Fu ( Office ) . "
As for Sh@@ ugo@@ sho ( governor 's office ) , at first , the mansion of the Gokenin of Kyoto Shugo ( Kyoto governor ) was designated because the person holding the post of Kyoto Shugo concurrently took charge of Yamashiro Province 's Shugo .
Later , Rokuhara Tandai held the post of the Province Shugo , and therefore , the office ( Sh@@ ugo@@ sho ) was moved to Rokuhara .
In Muromachi period , the Yamashiro Province was divided along the Uji River into three upper districts and five lower districts ; after an associate shugo ( shugodai ) was designated to each district the Sh@@ ugo@@ sho in charge of the three upper districts was situated in Uji Mak@@ ishima , while Sh@@ ugo@@ sho for the five lower districts were placed in several places such as Yodo .
Ichinomiya ( primary shrine ) , Provincial monastery ( temple ) , and Others
The provincial temple － with monastery for priests as well as conv@@ ent for priest@@ ess － , were located in Sor@@ aku District .
The Daig@@ okuden Hall of the Kuni no Miya Shrine was designated as a monastery ( so@@ ji ) in 7@@ 46 .
It was burned down in 8@@ 82 .
Afterwards it was reconstructed but its influence declined .
In Kamakura period , it seems that the temple was categorized as the lowest level temple within the Byod@@ o-in school
The provincial temple was located at present day Kam@@ o-cho , Kizugawa city .
In 1925 ( 14th year of Taisho ) a large number of old [ roof ] tiles were excavated near the provincial temple , and imp@@ lying that there was a conv@@ ent there .
In Eng@@ i-@@ Shiki Jin@@ mei-@@ cho ( shrines ' name direc@@ tory ) a total of 12@@ 2-@@ za and 9@@ 6-@@ sha are recorded , consisting of 5@@ 3-@@ za / 3@@ 7-@@ sha of taisha ( big shrines ) ( within these shrines , 2@@ 3-@@ za / 16@@ -@@ sha of dai myojin are included ) and 69@@ -@@ za / 5@@ 9-@@ sha of sho@@ sha ( small shrines ) . In addition to these shrines , 3@@ 6-@@ za ( 30 big za , and 6 small za ) in the imperial court and 3-@@ dai@@ za in Kyoto are also registered .
Kamo Shrines are the first shrines ( Ichinomiya ) in Kyoto － Kam@@ owak@@ eikaz@@ uchi Shrine ( called Kamig@@ amo Shrine ) at Kita district , and Kam@@ om@@ i@@ oya Shrine ( called Shimog@@ amo Shrine ) at Sakyo district .
Unlike in other local provinces , it is considered that Jing@@ i-@@ kan had some influence over the designation of the first shrine ( Ichinomiya ) in Yamashiro Province ; because of this , while the establishment of Ichinomiya in other provinces took place starting at the end of the 11th century the designation of Ichinomiya in Kinai ( Kansai Region ) began during the 12th century .
There is no secondary ( Nin@@ omiya ) and lower level shrines .
As for the so@@ ja shrine , the information is not available .

The Ikedaya Incident is the name given to an event that took place on July 8@@ ,@@ 1864 towards the end of the Edo Period in which the Shinsen-gumi , who was a peac@@ ek@@ e@@ eping organization under the Kyoto protec@@ tor@@ ate , attacked the imperial loy@@ alist faction from Choshu who were hiding out at the Ikedaya In@@ n at Kiy@@ amachi ( Sanj@@ ou@@ -@@ Kob@@ ashi Bridge ) on Sanj@@ ou@@ -@@ Street in Kyoto .
It is also known as the Ikedaya Rebellion , the Ikedaya U@@ pris@@ ing , or the Sanj@@ ou@@ -@@ kob@@ ashi Disturbance .
Isami KONDO called it the Raku@@ yo U@@ p@@ heav@@ al in his writings .
Kyoto at the end of the Edo period was the center of political power strugg@@ les , and ron@@ ins ( masterless samurai ) from different feudal clans who held such ideas as " rev@@ ere the emperor , expel foreigners " and imperi@@ alists were active behind the scenes .
The Choshu clan was overthrown by the Aizu and Satsuma clans in a coup on August 18th , and the Shogun@@ ate-@@ Imperial faction became the mainstream in the imperial court .
The " rev@@ ere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction was trying to recover its strength , and the Kyoto protec@@ tor@@ ate used the Shinsen-gumi for security and sear@@ ches in the city .
At around the end of May , mod@@ er@@ ators and observ@@ ers including Su@@ sum@@ u YAMAZAKI and Kai SHIMADA as@@ cer@@ tained the presence of Mas@@ uya store ( Shun@@ taro FURU@@ TA@@ KA ) that was operating a charcoal business in Shijo-@@ Kob@@ ashi-@@ A@@ gar@@ u-@@ Shin@@ -cho , and made a report to the Aizu clan .
We@@ ap@@ ons and communic@@ ations with the Choshu clan were found .
The Shinsen-gumi cap@@ tors requested Toshizo HIJIKATA to tor@@ ture FURU@@ TA@@ KA , who was co@@ er@@ ced into a conf@@ ession .
The plan was to wait for a wind@@ y day before the Gion festival and set fire to the Kyoto Imperial Palace , and in the en@@ su@@ ing confusion confin@@ ing Prince Asa@@ hiko NAKA@@ GA@@ WA@@ NOMIYA ( who became Asa@@ hiko KU@@ NI@@ NOMIYA later ) , assassinate Yoshinobu HI@@ T@@ OTSU@@ BASHI ( Yoshinobu T@@ U@@ GAWA ) and Katamori MATSUDAIRA of the Aizu clan , and take Emperor K@@ ou@@ m@@ you to Choshu .
Furthermore , the search revealed that the loy@@ alists from the Choshu , Tosa , and Higo clans were planning to hold a meeting at Ikedaya or Shik@@ oku@@ ya to discuss whether or not to go forward with the plan of attack after hearing about the arrest of FURU@@ TA@@ KA .
The Shinsen-gumi had asked for support from the Aizu , Kuwana , and other clans , but their actions were too sl@@ ow , and they did not move when the time came .
That is why the b@@ os@@ s , Isami KONDO , knowing that every moment counted , acted alone by spl@@ itting their members into two squ@@ ads under KONDO and HIJIKATA and began the search .
At the time , the Shinsen-gumi was short-@@ handed because many members were sick , so only 34 members took part in the search - 10 in the KONDO squad and 24 in the HIJIKATA squad ( There are different views on the numb@@ er@@ . c@@ f . List of Sol@@ di@@ ers In@@ vol@@ ved ) .
The HIJIKATA squad , a part of the Shinsen-gumi , sear@@ ched N@@ awate Street from Yas@@ aka Shrine , while the KONDO squad sear@@ ched Kiy@@ amachi Street across the Sanjo Bridge .
At the end of the search , the KONDO squad found radical nation@@ alists who were having a meeting at Ikedaya .
A few members of the KONDO squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night .
Four of the members - Isami KONDO , Soji O@@ KITA , Shinpachi NAGA@@ KURA , and Hei@@ suke TODO - first attacked the 20-@@ some radical nation@@ alists while the rest sh@@ ored up the peri@@ meter .
Some ron@@ ins f@@ ran@@ tically attacked Hay@@ at@@ ar@@ ou ANDO , Ei@@ suke OKU@@ ZAWA and Kaku@@ zaemon NITTA who guarded the back door , and succeeded to escape .
OKU@@ ZAWA died in the attack , and ANDO and NITTA died a month later .
O@@ KITA went inside the building and fought hard , but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it .
Some accounts say that this was because of a tub@@ er@@ cul@@ os@@ is@@ -@@ related blood sp@@ itting , but there is a lot of doubt and it is not certain .
Then , a sword hit the fore@@ head of TODO on the first floor when swe@@ at caused his helmet to sli@@ p out of place , and he withdrew from the battle .
Although there were KONDO and NAGA@@ KURA only at one point , the arrival of the HIJIKATA squad til@@ ted the od@@ ds in favor of the Shinsen-gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested .
Aizu and Kuwana clans arrived there to support them after the battle .
HIJIKATA would not let them any@@ where near , to ensure that they could not take credit .
Although some of the radical nation@@ alists escaped from the battle , the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out cl@@ earing operations with Aizu , Kuwana , and other clans .
The swe@@ ep of the city turned violent , and there were 5 immediate deaths among the Aizu clan , four among the Hikone clan , and two among the Kuwana clan .
At noon of the following day , the Shinsen-gumi returned to their base in Mibu Village . ( If they had returned to their base at night , they might have fallen into an am@@ bus@@ h , so they took a rest in the city until dawn . )
It is said that the ro@@ ad@@ side was crow@@ ded with on@@ look@@ ers .
The name of the Shinsen-gumi , which succeeded in preventing the plot to burn down the imperial palace , became famous throughout the land .
The " rev@@ ere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction , on the other hand , took a big bl@@ ow with the deaths of such important activ@@ ists as Toshim@@ aro YOSHIDA , K@@ ic@@ hima KITA@@ Z@@ OE , Tei@@ zo MIYA@@ BE , Mat@@ ajiro OTA@@ KA , Jun@@ jiro ISHIKAWA , Matsu@@ suke SUGI@@ YAMA and Ju@@ suke MATSUDA . ( They were later called the " Seven Mar@@ ty@@ r@@ s " by the new government . )
Kog@@ oro KATSURA ( later Takayoshi KIDO ) should have been there too , but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while . His life had been spar@@ ed because the incident occurred before he came back .
B@@ eg@@ inning with this incident , the Choshu clan fell under the influence of z@@ eal@@ ots and later came to Kyoto and raised the Kinmon rebellion on July 19 ( in the old calendar ) .
It has been said that the Ikedaya Incident delayed the Meiji Restoration by a year . There is also another opinion that it sp@@ ed up the Restoration by stir@@ ring up the " rev@@ ere the emperor , expel foreigners " faction .
Au@@ th@@ or Ryot@@ aro SHIBA 's interpretation is that the Meiji Restoration led by the four major clans of Satsuma , Choshu , Tosa , and Bizen would never have happened without this incident .

Murasaki Shikibu ( dates of birth and death unknown ) was a female author and poet in the mid-Heian period .
She is well known as the author of " The Tale of Genji . "
She is one of the Ch@@ uko Sanj@@ uro@@ k@@ kas@@ en ( medieval 36 Im@@ mortal Poets ) .
Her poem , ' I met a friend after so long , who went back in a hur@@ ry before I recognized his face ; like the moon goes behind a clou@@ d at a bl@@ ow ' was selected for " Ogura Hyakunin is@@ shu ( One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets ) . "
She was from the Fujiwara clan , and her name as a court lady was ' Fuji Shikibu ( Murasaki Shikibu ) . '
She acquired the sob@@ ri@@ qu@@ et of ' Murasaki ' from the name of the hero@@ ine ' Murasaki no Ue ' of " The Tale of Genji , " and ' Shikibu ' refers to her father 's position as Shiki@@ bu@@ tai@@ jo ( A@@ ide of Ceremon@@ ials ) .
Murasaki Shikibu 's real name is unknown , but it is assumed that she was the ' FUJIWARA no Ka@@ or@@ iko / Takako / Koshi , ' who became shoji ( ranked ) on January 29 , 100@@ 7 , which was described in ' M@@ ido Kanp@@ ak@@ uki ( FUJIWARA no Michinaga 's diary ) . '
However this view is generally based on the other as@@ sump@@ tions , which are said to contain er@@ rors in the process of making in@@ fer@@ ences , so it remains a matter of conj@@ ecture .
Also , her dates of birth and death are unknown , but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 100@@ 8 , based on historical materials and her works ; by counting back@@ wards from that age , she would have been born around 9@@ 79 and died around 10@@ 16 .
Trad@@ ition has it that she liked s@@ ard@@ ines , which was unusual for aristocracy , but this episode is based on a story of Izumi Shikibu in ' Sar@@ ug@@ en@@ ji no s@@ oshi ( The Sar@@ ug@@ en@@ ji Book ) , ' so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date .
She was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tam@@ etoki , governor of Echigo Province , and her mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tam@@ enobu from Settsu Province , but she lost her mother when she was little .
FUJIWARA no Nobun@@ ori was her brother by a different father , and apparently she also had an older sister .
FUJIWARA no Sad@@ akata , Sanjo Udaijin ( Sanjo minister of the right ) , and FUJIWARA no Kane@@ suke , Tsu@@ tsumi Chunagon ( vice-councilor of state ) , were her paternal great grand@@ fath@@ ers , and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers .
There are many anecdotes stating that , since her childhood , she had had more talent for reading Chinese classics than women were required to have in those days .
It is generally considered that she wrote both " The Tale of Genji , " which consists of 54 chapters , and " Murasaki Shikibu Diary , " which was about her days in service to the Imperial Court , as well as " Collection of Murasaki Shikibu 's Works . "
Her father , FUJIWARA no Tam@@ etoki , obtained employ@@ ment as a read@@ er in Togu ( the palace of the Crown Prince ) while in his thir@@ ties , and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo ( Chamberlain ) and then to Shiki@@ bu@@ tai@@ jo ; however , when the Emperor became a priest , he lost his job .
Ten years later , as a con@@ sequence of dedic@@ ating a poem to Emperor Ichijo , he became a governor of Echizen Province .
Murasaki Shikibu , during her childhood , spent two years in the place of her father 's assign@@ ment .
In about 99@@ 8 , she married a governor of Yamashiro Province FUJIWARA no Nobutaka , who was old enough to be her father ; in 99@@ 9 she bore him a daughter , FUJIWARA no Kat@@ aiko / Kenshi , but this marriage life didn 't last long because Nobutaka died soon afterward .
In December 29 ( according to the lunar calendar ) of 100@@ 5 , she began serving the Empress of Emperor Ichijo FUJIWARA no Shoshi / Akiko ( the oldest daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga , and later given the name of the Retired Emperor J@@ otom@@ onin ) as a court lady-@@ c@@ um-@@ tut@@ or , and she served the Empress at least until 10@@ 11 .
There is a poem created by ISE no Taifu , ' Some time ago , double-@@ flow@@ ered cherry trees blo@@ om@@ ed in the color@@ ful capital of Nara ; today they bloom in Ku@@ ju Castle in this capital of Kyo , as they did before , ' which was collected in " Shi@@ ka Wakashu ( Collection of Poetry ) " ; the poem was written in dedic@@ ation to the Empress along with y@@ ae@@ zakura ( double cherry blossoms ) presented to the Imperial Court ; however , according to " ISE no Taifu shu ( Private Collection ) " it was supposed to be a duty of Murasaki Shikibu , but she deleg@@ ated the duty to a new@@ com@@ er , Taifu .
The last description about Murasaki Shikibu appears in " Sh@@ oyuki , " the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke , dated May 25 ( lunar calendar ) 10@@ 14 , saying that ' as " a daughter of Tam@@ etoki , who was a governor of Echigo Province , " she conveyed a message from the wife of the Retired Empress Shoshi to Sanesuke . '
Therefore it is widely believed that she died between 10@@ 12 and 10@@ 16 , in the reign of Emperor Sanjo , but some people dis@@ agree .
Also , tradition has it that Murasaki Shikibu 's grave can be found at Murasaki no Nis@@ hig@@ o@@ sh@@ od@@ en-@@ cho ( Horikawa Kitaoji Kud@@ aru , West side ) , Kita Ward , Kyoto City .
Today , the Bank of Japan 's D@@ -@@ note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of Murasaki Shikibu and a part of " The Tale of Genji Emaki ( picture scroll ) " on its back side .
Her name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the United N@@ ations Educational , Sci@@ entific and Cultural Organization ( = U@@ NE@@ S@@ C@@ O ) , and she was the only Japanese to be thus en@@ rolled .
You can read some comments about her contemporary famous court ladies .
Ab@@ ove all , a comment about Sei Shonagon , the author of The P@@ illow Book , is the most famous ( the following is a free translation ) :
Sei Shonagon is a j@@ er@@ k who acts pro@@ ud@@ ly . Chinese characters , she bl@@ ots in a wise , have full of mist@@ akes . ' ( " Murasaki Diary " Kuro@@ k@@ aw@@ ab@@ on ( type of manuscript ) )
" W@@ ill the life of a person with such ins@@ inc@@ erity be better in the future ? " ( from " Murasaki Diary " Kuro@@ k@@ aw@@ ab@@ on )
These comments are quite severe and can be said to be almost back@@ b@@ iting .
These descriptions have been brought into conversation with various conj@@ ec@@ tures and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity ( Murasaki Shikibu was jeal@@ ous of the talent of Sei Shonagon , etc . ) up until recently .
However , these two people were distant in age and served the Imperial Court in different times ( nearly a dec@@ ade ) , so they seem not to have known each other .
She wrote some positive comments about her contemporary female poets , Izumi Shikibu ( ' her behavior is not good , but her poems are excellent , ' etc . ) , and Ak@@ az@@ om@@ e-@@ emon .
Emperor Ichijo had a court lady read al@@ oud " The Tale of Genji , " at which he praised the author , saying she must have been an e@@ ager read@@ er of Nihongi ( according to " Sh@@ oku-@@ Nihongi ( Continu@@ ation of Chronicles of Japan ) , " whereby Nihongi refers to " Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) " ; thus some people claim that " Nihongi " in this context means " Nihonshoki " ) .
Because of this , Murasaki Shikibu was given the nickname ' Nihongi no Ot@@ subone , ' but it is widely thought that the Emperor 's words brought her into ri@@ dic@@ u@@ le because it was felt that a woman shou@@ ldn 't read Chinese classics , and she was dist@@ ressed by the words .
Murasaki Diary and " Eiga monogatari ( A Tale of Flow@@ ering Fort@@ un@@ es ) , " the latter of which has some descriptions common to the Murasaki Diary , states that Michinaga visited her chamber at night .
Additionally , " Various Japanese Family Tre@@ es " ( " New Comp@@ il@@ ation of Various Japanese Family Tre@@ es Anal@@ ogy " ) says that ' a court lady of J@@ otom@@ onin , a poet , Murasaki Shikibu , an author of The Tale of Genji , or Masat@@ ada 's grand@@ daughter , Tam@@ etoki 's daughter , mistress of Michinaga , the chief adviser to the Emperor , ' which clearly shows that she was a mistress of Michinaga , but the true relationship between them is unknown .

Takauji ASHIKAGA ( 130@@ 5-@@ 58 ) was a general from the late Kamakura period to the Northern and Southern Courts period .
He was the 1st Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate .
Takauji was a descendant of the Genji clan .
He was the 1st son of Sad@@ auji ASHIKAGA , who was a descendant in the direct line of the Ashikaga clan , which was the powerful family in Kawachi Genji .
In his early years , he was given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO .
In 1333 , when the Emperor Go-@@ Daigo had raised an army at Mt . Sen@@ j@@ osan in Hoki Province , Takauji , the powerful vassal of the Kamakura shogunate , was sent to Kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion , but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shin@@ om@@ ura Hachimangu in Tam@@ ba Province to capture Rokuhara Tandai .
His achievements were evaluated by Emperor Go-@@ Daigo , and he was awarded the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor 's real name Tak@@ aharu ( 尊@@ 治 ) , so he changed the letter in his name from " 高@@ 氏 " to " 尊@@ 氏 " .
While the des@@ po@@ tic Kenmu restoration by Emperor Go-@@ Daigo had been losing support , Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakas@@ endai Rebellion , and stayed in Kamakura to try to build his own government .
Because of this , the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an imp@@ ass@@ e , and he returned to Kyoto , driving the Emperor Go-@@ Daigo out to Mt . Hiei . However , the Emperor 's army made a counter@@ attack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily .
He re@@ entered Kyoto and established a new samurai government called the Muromachi Shogunate , being appointed Seii Taishogun by Grand Emperor ( Retired Emperor ) Kogon and Emperor Komyo .
At the same time , Emperor Go-@@ Daigo moved to Yoshino and set up the Southern Court there .
After he established the Muromachi Shogunate , he and his brother Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA divided power between them , but in later years disc@@ ord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance .
The disturbance sub@@ sided with the death of Tadayoshi , but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies , such as the Southern Court forces , to maintain his government .
After Emperor Go-@@ Daigo died , Takauji built Tenryu-ji Temple to pray for the dead .
Because of his rebellion against the emperor , people had bran@@ ded him as a tr@@ ait@@ or since the Meiji era , but after World War II they began to look at him more posit@@ ively , which illustr@@ ates how much the historical point of view aff@@ ects the way we look at the people in history .
From Bir@@ th to the F@@ all of the Kamakura Shogunate
Takauji was born in 130@@ 5 .
There are 3 pre@@ sump@@ tions about his birthplace : Ayabe ( Ue@@ sug@@ isho in Ayabe City , Kyoto ) , Kamakura and Ashik@@ ag@@ ano sho ( Ashikaga City , Tochigi Prefecture ) .
" N@@ an-@@ Taiheiki " says that when Takauji was given his first bath , two tur@@ t@@ led@@ ov@@ es fle@@ w in ; one per@@ ched on his shoulder , and the other on the di@@ pper .
His childhood name was Mat@@ ataro .
On October 10th , 13@@ 19 , his coming-of-age ceremony ( Gen@@ puku ) was held at age 15 , and he was appointed Ji@@ bu@@ taifu of the Fifth Rank , Junior Grade , and given the name Takauji by the regent Takatoki HOJO .
Takauji 's father Sad@@ auji and his official wife Shak@@ ado , daughter of Akit@@ oki HOJO , had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA , but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father .
According to " N@@ an-@@ Taiheiki " , I@@ etoki ASHIKAGA , Takauji 's grandfather , killed himself with his sword , praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations .
In 13@@ 31 , Emperor Go-@@ Daigo plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kas@@ agi ( Genko Incident ) .
The Kamakura shogunate ordered Takauji , who had been a powerful vassal , to help the shogunate , and he joined the battles at Kas@@ agi where the emperor was based and at Shim@@ o@@ ak@@ asaka Castle in which Masashige KUSUNOKI was based .
The incident had taken place just after his father 's death , so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate , but the Kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as ho@@ stages to make Takauji follow its order .
According to " Kot@@ en-@@ Taiheiki , " because of this Takauji began to har@@ bor host@@ ility toward the shogunate .
As a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate , the emperor and his followers such as Toshim@@ oto HINO and En@@ kan were captured , and the following year Emperor Go-@@ Daigo was exiled to Oki Islands ( Genko Rebellion ) .
The shogunate installed Emperor Kogon of the Jim@@ yo-in line as emperor , instead of Emperor Go-@@ Daigo of the Daikaku-ji line .
In the following year , Emperor Go-@@ Daigo escaped from Oki Islands , and raised an army at Mt . Sen@@ j@@ osan .
Takauji was ordered to re@@ enter Kyoto with Takaie NA@@ GO@@ E to put down the rebellion in the west .
Takaie was killed by Nor@@ imura AKAMATSU , which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor . On April 2@@ 9th of the same year , he raised an army against the shogunate at Shin@@ om@@ ura Hachimangu ( present Kameoka City , Kyoto ) in Tam@@ ba Province .
Takauji gathered forces from various provinces , and entered Kyoto followed by vassals such as Doyo SASAKI from Omi Province , and then succeeded in destro@@ ying Rokuhara Tandai on May 7th , 1333 .
At about the same time , Yoshisada NITTA , vassal of Kozuke Province , also gathered an army , and destroyed the shogunate , taking Takauji 's heir Sen@@ ju@@ o ( later called Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA ) , who had escaped from Kamakura , with him .
In this fighting , Tak@@ ew@@ ak@@ amaru , the son of Takauji 's concubine , was killed .
After the Kamakura shogunate was cr@@ umb@@ led , Takauji ordered Kazu@@ uji HOSOKAWA , Yori@@ haru HOSOKAWA and Mor@@ ouji HOSOKAWA to make Yoshisada NITTA return to Kyoto , and let the Ashikaga clan rule Kamakura .
After the fall of the Kamakura shogunate , Emperor Go-@@ Daigo considered Takauji 's work to be comm@@ end@@ able , and gave him the ranks of Chin@@ ju@@ fu Shogun and Sahyoe no Kami with the cour@@ tly title of Fourth Rank , Junior Grade , along with 30 pl@@ ots of land .
In addition to that , he was given the letter ( 尊 ) , which came from the emperor 's given name , and changed the letter of his name Takauji ( 高@@ 氏 ) into Takauji ( 尊@@ 氏 ) .
Under the Kenmu administration , Takauji left politics and let KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , and KO no Mor@@ oyasu eng@@ age in politics , while he made his brother Tadayoshi the regent of the Kamakura Shogun@@ fu .
There are two interpre@@ tations of Takauji 's behavior ; one is that it was Emperor Go-@@ Daigo who made Takauji leave politics , and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government .
There is also a different pre@@ sumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in Kamakura .
This condition was called " Takauji 's absence in the new government " .
While Emperor Go-@@ Daigo appointed Akiie KITABATAKE as Chin@@ ju@@ fu Shogun and made him take Prince Nor@@ iyoshi ( later called Emperor GO@@ -@@ Murakami ) to Oshu in order to pac@@ ify the place , Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Nar@@ inaga ( Nar@@ iyoshi ) down to Kamakura .
Emperor Go-@@ Daigo 's son Prince Mor@@ inaga , who also cov@@ eted the title of Seii Taishogun , gradually came to rival Takauji , and plotted to assassinate him , but Takauji 's security was so tig@@ ht that he failed to do it .
In 13@@ 34 , Takauji captured and confined Prince Mor@@ inaga , who was in conflict with the emperor too , to Tadayoshi 's place in Kamakura , con@@ spir@@ ing with the emperor 's mistress Yasuko ( Kad@@ oko ) A@@ NO , who wanted to make her son Prince Tsun@@ enaga ( Tsun@@ eyoshi ) a crown prince .
In 13@@ 35 , Nakas@@ endai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the surv@@ iv@@ ors of the HOJO clan , taking Tok@@ iyuki HOJO , bereaved son of Takatoki HOJO , with them , and Tok@@ iyuki 's army occupied Kamakura temporarily .
In the rebellion , Tadayoshi killed Prince Mor@@ inaga without permission .
Takauji requested that Emperor Go-@@ Daigo appoint him Seii Taishogun only to be rejected , so he marched to Kamakura without emperor 's permission on August 2nd of the same year , which made Emperor Go-@@ Daigo reluc@@ tan@@ tly appoint him as Sei@@ to Taishogun .
Tadayoshi 's army , joined by Takauji , defeated Tok@@ iyuki HOJO at the Battle of Sag@@ am@@ igawa and regained Kamakura on the 19th of the same month .
Takauji was given the cour@@ tly title of the Second Rank .
With Tadayoshi 's approval , Takauji established a base in Kamakura and began to all@@ ot lands to his followers , ign@@ oring the emperor 's command to return to Kyoto , and he tried to establish his own samurai government .
In November , Takauji suggested to the emperor that Yoshisada NITTA was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed , but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji , making Yoshisada take Prince Tak@@ anaga ( Takayoshi ) to Kamakura along Tokaido .
Besides that , Akiie KITABATAKE began to go down to Kyoto from Oshu , so Takauji declared his retirement to get a re@@ pri@@ eve . However , once the Ashikaga side , including Tadayoshi and KO no Moronao , began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa , Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government .
In December of the same year , Takauji defeated Nitta 's army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shi@@ ta , and advanced his army up to Kyoto .
During that time , Takauji secretly made contact with Emperor Kogon of the Jim@@ yo-in line to just@@ ify his entering Kyoto .
In the following month , Takauji reached Kyoto , while Emperor GO@@ -@@ Daigo fled to Mt . Hiei .
Sh@@ ort@@ ly thereafter , Takauji was attacked in Kyoto by the armies of Akiie KITABATAKE , Masashige KUSUNOKI and Yoshisada NITTA from Oshu , and he gave up Kyoto , accepting En@@ shin AKAMATSU 's advice to leave for Kyushu .
On his way down to Kyushu , Yoshinao ( Yori@@ hisa ) SHO@@ NI came to meet him at Ak@@ amag@@ as@@ eki , Nagato Province ( present Shimonoseki City , Yamaguchi Prefecture ) , and he was supported by Ujin@@ ori MU@@ NAKA@@ TA , the chief priest of Mun@@ akata Taisha Shrine in Mun@@ akata , Chikuzen Province .
In the beginning of March , after visiting Mun@@ akata Taisha , Takauji defeated Tak@@ etoshi KIKUCHI ( Emperor Go-@@ Daigo 's side ) at the Battle of Tat@@ ar@@ ahama ( present Fukuoka City ) , and on his way up to Kyoto , he got Emperor Kogon 's order and immediately gathered western warriors .
He sm@@ ashed the armies of Yoshisada NITTA and Masashige KUSUNOKI at the Battle of Minat@@ ogawa on April 25th of the same year , and seized Kyoto again in June .
Takauji attempted a reconciliation with Emperor Go-@@ Daigo , who had been at Mt . Hiei , to save face for the emperor .
Emperor Go-@@ Daigo , accepting Takauji 's offer , transferred the Imperial Reg@@ alia of Japan to Emperor Komyo , a younger brother of Grand Emperor Kogon , and right after that , on November 7th , Takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government , setting the Kenmu Shik@@ imoku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people .
Emperor Go-@@ Daigo escaped from Kyoto to Yoshino ( present Yoshin@@ o-cho , Yoshin@@ o-gun , Nara Prefecture ) taking the Imperial Reg@@ alia of Japan with him in December , and announced that the transferred reg@@ alia were f@@ ake , so he established Yoshino Imperial Court ( = Southern Court ) .
In 13@@ 38 , Takauji was appointed Seii Taishogun ( reigned 13@@ 3@@ 8-@@ 58 ) by Emperor Komyo , which meant that an actual samurai government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established .
In the following year , when Emperor Go-@@ Daigo passed away in Yoshino , Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor .
In order to raise the funds to build the temple , a trading vessel called Ten@@ ry@@ u-@@ ji-@@ b@@ une was set s@@ ail for Yuan Dynasty .
Under the new government , Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals .
Shin '@@ ichi Sato called such conditions di@@ archy by Takauji , who held a military power in the l@@ ord@@ -@@ and-@@ vassal relationship , and Tadayoshi , who controlled the judicial functions of the regime , in his essay ' Muromachi Bakufu ' in " I@@ aw@@ anami Ko@@ za Nihon Rek@@ ishi vol@@ .@@ 7 " ( I@@ aw@@ anami Publishing , 1963 ) and explained that the pot@@ enti@@ ality of the shogun 's d@@ ual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate , came to appear .
The d@@ ual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-@@ Tadayoshi group represented by KO no Moronao , and the Tadayoshi group in the government .
This conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance .
At first Takauji took a neutr@@ al stance on it , but he came to side with Moronao 's group .
In 13@@ 49 , Moronao demanded Tadayoshi 's retirement from politics , surrounding Takauji 's castle in which Tadayoshi had shel@@ tered .
Tadayoshi became a priest and lost his power , but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to ex@@ clude Tadayoshi .
While Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from Kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi , he sent his second son Mot@@ ouji ASHIKAGA to Kamakura in return and set the Kam@@ akur@@ afu to rule the eastern provinces , appointing Mot@@ ouji Kamakura kubo .
After Tadayoshi 's retreat , Takauji 's illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi 's adopted son - Tada@@ fuyu ASHIKAGA was en@@ lar@@ ging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu , so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tada@@ fuyu in 13@@ 50 .
Then Tadayoshi escaped from Kyoto and sided with the Southern Court , followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MO@@ MONO@@ I and Kun@@ ikiyo HATAKEYAMA .
When Tadayoshi 's army grew stronger , Yoshiakira became pow@@ er@@ less and fled from Kyoto . Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi 's army at Uchi@@ de@@ hama in Settsu Province ( present Nishin@@ omiya City , Hyogo Prefecture ) .
Takauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests , and they came to an agreement in 13@@ 51 .
The KO brothers were assassinated by Yoshinori UESUGI while they were under escor@@ t .
Tadayoshi became Yoshiakira 's assistant and got involved in political affairs again .
Takauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the o@@ st@@ en@@ sible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by Doyo SASAKI and Soku@@ yu ( Nori@@ suke ) AKAMATSU , but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court , con@@ spir@@ ing to kill Tadayoshi and Tada@@ fuyu .
Sen@@ sing this conspiracy , Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached Kamakura .
In October of the same year , Takauji and the Southern Court reconc@@ iled , an event that was called Sho@@ h@@ ei-@@ it@@ to .
At the same time , Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the Tokaido , and defeated him at the battles of Mt . S@@ atsu@@ tam@@ ayama in Suruga Province ( present-day Shimizu Ward , Shimizu City , Shizuoka Prefecture ) and Hay@@ ak@@ aw@@ aj@@ iri in Sagami Province ( present-day Odawara City , Kanagawa Prefecture ) . Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in Kamakura .
Tadayoshi died suddenly in February , 13@@ 52 .
" Taiheiki " says that Tadayoshi might have been pois@@ oned by Takauji .
Soon after Tadayoshi 's death , being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Mun@@ eyoshi , Yoshioki NITTA , Yoshimune NITTA and Tok@@ iyuki HOJO , Takauji retreated to Musashi Province , but soon returned to Kyoto to defeat the Southern forces .
After that Tada@@ fuyu ASHIKAGA in@@ tr@@ uded in Kyoto , but eventually he left for Kyushu .
In 13@@ 54 , Kyoto was ret@@ ak@@ en by the Southern Court temporarily , but taken back by Takauji the following year .
He plotted to kill Tada@@ fuyu , but died of a t@@ um@@ or on his back at the palace of M@@ ade '@@ n@@ okoji in Nijo , Kyoto , on April 30@@ th , 13@@ 58 .
His age at death : 54 .
According to " Bai@@ shor@@ on , " Takauji reg@@ ret@@ ted having turned against Emperor Go-@@ Daigo , and he for a while he was tal@@ king about becoming a priest . In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself , so Shin '@@ ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration , and presumed that Takauji might have been a man@@ ic de@@ pres@@ sive .
Takauji 's close friend Soseki MU@@ SO described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing .
Takauji was w@@ illing to all@@ ot lands to his military commanders , which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations .
It was the Mit@@ og@@ aku originated by Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA that started to consider Takauji as a tr@@ ait@@ or in the Edo period .
Mit@@ og@@ aku was strongly influenced by Shus@@ hig@@ aku Mei@@ bun@@ ron , and emphasized the val@@ idity of the Imperial line .
Because of this , Takauji , who exiled the auth@@ entic emperor ( Go-@@ Daigo ) , was described in a negative way as a tr@@ ait@@ or .
Mit@@ og@@ aku 's view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations , and in the late Tokugawa period when Son@@ no-@@ Joi ( Rev@@ ere the Emperor , Ex@@ pel the Bar@@ bar@@ ian ) cul@@ min@@ ated , the heads of wooden statues of Takauji , Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu ( ASHIKAGA ) in To@@ ji-@@ in were pill@@ or@@ ied .
After the Meiji period , the Meiji government sought to establish a nation@@ -@@ state which set the emperor in the center of the nation . This produced a nation@@ alistic view of history , which just@@ ified Taisei Hokan and O@@ sei Fuk@@ ko , and so the Taika Reforms , Kenmu no Ch@@ uko ( = Kenmu restoration ) and Meiji Restoration were ranked as the most important reforms .
Until mid Meiji period , sour@@ c@@ e-@@ based study of modern history did not emphas@@ ize the val@@ idity of Emperor Go-@@ Daigo ( the Southern Court ) , but at around 1907 40 when the Nan@@ boku@@ cho Sei@@ jun@@ ron arose , the val@@ idity of Emperor Go-@@ Daigo came to be st@@ ressed , creating a negative evaluation of Takauji .
According to an authorized text@@ book written before W@@ W@@ II , Takauji was " a tr@@ ait@@ or who released an arrow against the Emperor " , and Kum@@ ak@@ ichi NAKAJIMA , a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet , was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing .
After W@@ W@@ II , the nation@@ alistic view of history became ob@@ sol@@ ete , and the sour@@ c@@ e-@@ based study of history made progress on re@@ evalu@@ ating Takauji .
Sato 's interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the l@@ ord@@ -@@ and-@@ vassal relationship was one example , which af@@ for@@ ded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government .
In today 's historical study , nobody interpre@@ ts Takauji as a tr@@ ait@@ or any more , and the process of Takauji 's becoming a tr@@ ait@@ or sometimes can be a theme of historical study .
" Shi@@ hon Taiheiki " written by Ei@@ ji YOSHI@@ KAWA in the late 195@@ 0s had Takauji as a main character , and was accepted by many readers , which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before W@@ W@@ II .
" Kib@@ am@@ u@@ sha zo " ( a portrait of warrior on the horse back ) , preserved in the Kyoto National Museum , was generally known as a portrait of Takauji , but is now considered to be a portrait of KO no Moronao , the regent of the Ashikaga clan , or that of KO no Moro@@ akira , son of Moronao . It 's because there 's a decorative signature of the 2nd shogun Yoshiakira on the upper part of the body , and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior 's har@@ ness was not the Ashikaga family 's , but the KO family 's .
Por@@ tr@@ ait of Taira no Shigemori , one of the Jingo-ji san zo , painted by FUJIWARA no Takanobu in Kamakura period , had been considered a portrait of Shigemori TAIRA , but Michi@@ o YO@@ NE@@ KURA and Hideo KURODA claimed that it is a portrait of Takauji , and now this interpretation is widely accepted .
Their opinion is based on the comparison of the portrait with the wooden statue of Takauji preserved in To@@ ji-@@ in , and the popular shape of the hat@@ pin , called Kog@@ ai , used in the early Muromachi period .
There 's another portrait of Takauji preserved in Jod@@ o-ji Temple in On@@ omichi City , Hiroshima Prefecture .
In addition to that , there are some uki@@ yoe pictures of Takauji : " Taiheiki K@@ ass@@ en@@ zu , " by Yoshit@@ ora UTAGAWA ; and " Ashikaga Takauji Hyogo K@@ ass@@ en@@ zu , " by Chikan@@ obu HASHIMOTO . Both paintings deal with Takauji shel@@ tering in the Jod@@ o-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture .
Also some bronze statues of Takauji were made recently ; one is placed on the approach to the Bun@@ n@@ a-ji Temple in Ashikaga City , and the other is in An@@ koku@@ ji Town , Ayabe City , Kyoto Prefecture .

Ref@@ erence
The private local bus oper@@ ators Keihan Kyoto Kotsu ( formerly Kyoto Kotsu ( Kameoka Station ) , Kyoto Kotsu ( Maizuru ) and Kyoto Bus have no capital or personnel relationship with Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau .
The labor union of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau is Kyoto Kotsu L@@ ab@@ or Un@@ ions ( a member of the All Japan Municipal Transport Wor@@ kers ' Union ) .
The labor union of Kyoto Bus Co . , Ltd . , is the Kyoto Bus L@@ ab@@ or Union , and the labor union of Keihan Kyoto Kotsu is the Keihan Kyoto Bus L@@ ab@@ or Union ( both of which are members of the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Wor@@ kers ' Union Japan ) .
The Kyoto City Transportation Bureau is the only Japanese transportation enter@@ prise that holds the cop@@ y@@ right to its departure mel@@ o@@ dies .
In 2007 , one of its bus lines was found to be in service without an approval of the Ministry of Land , In@@ frastructure , Transport and Tour@@ ism .
One Kyoto City bus appeared in a local campaign film during the 2007 fiscal year , which was produced by the Japan A@@ d Council with a message saying , " It runs on w@@ aste tempura oil . "
The commercial film says that bi@@ o-@@ diesel fu@@ el made from w@@ aste vegetable oil is used for city buses and gar@@ b@@ age tr@@ uc@@ ks as a substitute for light oil in their activities , as a means for the prevention of glob@@ al warm@@ ing as advocated by the Kyoto Pro@@ tocol of 1997 .
This commercial film , produced by the Japan A@@ d Council 's Osaka Bureau , aired mainly on Kansai local TV ( partially nationwide ) .
The Sei@@ mei-@@ jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Kamigyo Ward of Kyoto City .
It 's dedicated to Seimei ABE .
It 's located at the site of his premises , which once existed near ( northwest of ) the Ichijo Mod@@ ori-@@ bashi .
There are many shrines nationwide with the same name .
When Seimei died in 100@@ 5 , Ichi@@ j@@ yo , the Emperor of the time , admired his work and called him the re@@ incarnation of Inari the god . A shrine was built and dedicated to him at the site of his premises in 100@@ 7 .
The area of the shrine was large at first but gradually dimin@@ ished through events like wars and the urban improvement by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and its buildings were left dec@@ ayed .
From the last days of the T@@ ugawa shogunate , the shrine 's buildings and precincts were repaired by funds raised mainly by the shrine parishi@@ oners . In 1950 , the shrine 's area was changed to face Horikawa street .
During the Heisei era , Seimei ABE became extremely popular and worshi@@ p@@ ers have come to visit the shrine from all over the country .
The mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um comm@@ em@@ oration for Seimei ABE was held in 2005 , when a thousand years had passed since his death .

The 22 Shrines are part of the Shak@@ aku for Shinto shrines .
They were established from the middle to late Heian period .
These shrines receive special offerings from the Imperial Court .
They are mostly chosen from shrines in the Kinai area .
Estab@@ lishment of the 22 Shrines
Under the Ritsuryo system , offerings were given by the Imperial court for Kin@@ en-@@ sai and other festivals to many shrines listed in the Eng@@ i-@@ shiki Jim@@ myo-@@ cho ; but that number has been reduced to a special few shrines after the decline of the Ritsuryo system .
That number and the shrines in it changed many times and came to include some newly established shrines , before being fin@@ alized as the following 22 Shrines in 10@@ 81 .
Although the movement at the end of the Heian period to include Itsuk@@ ushima Shrine was not successful , that shrine received offerings from the imperial court until the latter part of the Muromachi period , and even in the Edo period in the event of disasters .

In " Ju@@ j@@ ur@@ itsu " it indicates the ord@@ aining master .
In Japan the title of Dai@@ osho ( Great O@@ sho ) was given to Ganjin , who came over to teach the precepts in 7@@ 58 , and later was used as a title of respect for high level priests , and eventually for those at the level of chief priest and above .
The manner of writing and pronunciation varies by sect , and in some regions the word is even shortened to ' Os@@ san ' or ' Os@@ sama ' ( with the acc@@ ent in the beginning ) .
